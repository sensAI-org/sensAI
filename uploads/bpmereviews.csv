Review
With small children in the car, this is perfect, and just works!
Very easy to set up and use and looks very slick
This app is better than sliced bread.
So easy to use and beats waiting in the queue to pay when itâ€™s busy!
Does exactly what I need it to do!
Please allow me to pay via my Jaguar car touchscreen
Quite amazed by how quick the pumps gets unlocked! Bye bye queuing to pay.
It works!  Driving off without going into the shop was exciting ðŸ™‚. Bring on the coffee pre order option.
"Using this app on the day of release was fabulous. But thing changed on next week. 

Now because of new changes the pump will stop at Â£XXX.50. For example if you fill up for Â£40.00 the pump will stop at Â£39.50 and It is absolutely fine. Bank hold the Â£40.00 till BP request. I thought my Barclays will released Â£39.50 to BP and will return Â£0.50 to me after 10 days.

However when BP requested for Â£39.50, which is the correct that I filled up for my car, my Barclays released Â£39.50 to BP but still holding Â£40 because thats the amount that i authorised from my phone. No idea when I will see that Â£40 back in my account hopefully after 10days later.

Please consider the following points before you use this app.

1) You will need Â£20 to fill up just Â£10 as Bank will hold up extra Â£10 for donâ€™t know how long.

2) You make sure to check the pump before you authorised the payment. Because once you authorised bank will hold the money for at least 10 days even pump is not working. If you have extra money for the month this will not be issue but I have. 

love the idea but things are not smooth as I expected yet. BP should work with Apple Pay or Google Pay to avoid this problem."
Log in button blinks when I tap it but does nothing. Useless.
Normally arrive at petrol station and have to muck around getting my wallet and card and then wander into the shop. Now I donâ€™t. Itâ€™s great.
Would not accept Amex card, and could not get Nectar card to load.  Add to that the privacy policy where they seem able to do whatever with your data- Iâ€™ve decided to do it the old way.
Very shocking that BP app cannot add Amex as a payment card or cannot add Apple Pay as a payment method. Been using Shell app with those since nearly 2 years.
The few issues Iâ€™ve found with the app is that not all stations have it, and, if you want to fill your tank completely itâ€™s useless. However, it is nice as the pump will lock itself after however much youâ€™ve put in. Also not having to queue in the store saves so much time.
I always pay with Amex in BP but the app doesnâ€™t cater for it. Shame as itâ€™s such a great idea and I would use it otherwise
Can't add Amex as a payment method. Why release an app that does not accept all current methods of payment that can be accepted at the till? I work within technology and look after Business As Usual - BAU. I would not have accepted this app into BAU for the following reasons: 1) Scanning card function is slow and takes a few tries to work. 2) App does not accept all payment methods currently accepted at the till. 3) Very scary reviews about money being taken out of account in a different way than paying at the till. There should be no detriment to any customer for using this new app. Folks, it's not rocket science to get this right. You should not have rushed to market until you were ready. Learn to push back and say not yet until you are ready.
"Used this for the first time today and got apprehended by the boys in blue who saw me fill up me beemer then race off without paying!!
Had a right old time explaining to them 'I paid by App' 'yeah right - pull the other' he said and frog marched me to the til only for the nice lady to explain it to him!
 Great App, works perfectly- just watch out for the cops!"
Can't get it set up as it doesn't accept my Amex. Waste of time.
The app is brilliant and saves time but when you set a fixed amount the pump stops short by exactly 50p, it has done it both times Iâ€™ve used it.
Doesn't take the leading fuel card sadly. No use to me then. What a shame.
Love this idea. The only fault I have at this stage is that this facility has not been rolled out to all stations. When it does it will get 5 stars.
No use until Amex is accepted!
Filled up at my local BP garage using this app for the first time. Put Â£44 into my car and finished all fine, Checked my internet banking and there was a Â£100 pending charge on my account from BP! Two days later BP have took the Â£44 out of my account that I filled up but I still have a Â£100 pending transaction from them, Iâ€™ve had to contact the bank to get them to look into it!!
"Being a tech savvy person I can guarantee that at the moment in the UK this is the best app and payment method with minimum complexity . Iâ€™ve got Shell app and itâ€™s super complicated. Only thing I found was the price of fuel is slighter higher and also if I were to fill from Shell I normally fill at 40 where as BP was at 48 but that been said itâ€™s not an accurate measure.
Overall 5 star to BP. Good work. Near App"
Good idea and works really well, just donâ€™t choose the full tank option. BP will allocate Â£100 from your account for up to two weeks. Had a direct debit cancelled as my money was tied up.
Pathetic app. Always asks me to login then just sits there. Eventually I just decided to pay in the shop. Tried on two BP visits. Deleted. BP petrol prices are a rip off anyway.
"Update: American Express now works fine

Canâ€™t use AMEX but yet can use it in store"
Doesnâ€™t recognise any of my cards. Useless.
Amazing app, one of the best integrations Iâ€™ve seen, will be 5 stars the second Apple Pay is supported
Have to log on and enter security question every time on iPhone X
"Instead of asking you to pay for the service, they track you and sell your info to pay for it.

Same as tesco clubcards, nectar rewards and every other data mining scheme."
Have registered with BP Me, verified my email address and password, but when I try to access the app with my user credentials, it keeps throwing me back to the login/register screen.
"Good app, will be using regularly. The BP Plus Routex card type needs to be added as a payment option though - Iâ€™d have thought this wouldâ€™ve been a day one option? Hopefully thisâ€™ll be added soon!

Good app otherwise!"
I was filling my car yesterday and the meter continued to register fuel and an increasing charge even after fuel stopped flowing. I was certain the fuel had stopped flowing so I carefully removed the nozzle to confirm. Sure enough, no fuel flowing and the meter was still counting!
Think the developer needs to sort out payment methods, tried adding my company MasterCard and it just said error check number, tried manual entry and photo no joy.
Downloaded, set up account, wouldnâ€™t add payment card(s) and then immediately suspended my new account. Shame, it would have been really useful.
Seems like it could be a good app if it could locate any petrol stations. Always says Iâ€™m not near one even though I live just round the corner from one.
"Absolutely hopeless. â€œFreezesâ€ Â£100 from your bank account when you select â€œfull tankâ€ regardless of how much you spend.
Select any other amount and the pump delivers 50p less! 
I fill up my vehicle every night, and canâ€™t afford to have Â£100 â€œfrozenâ€ from my bank account. In theory, after 1 week I could have Â£700 â€œpending transactionsâ€ in my bank account despite only spending Â£150-Â£200.
Also, to print-off the receipt involves printing 2 A4 pages. Waste of paper & ink, so much for your care for the environment."
I was recommended this app by a friend and I was a bit doubtful as I thought it would be similar to a pay at pump experience. However, it was much easier than that. No need to get your card out, enter your pin code, wait in the cold for the card to be authorised, etc. Just enter the pump number from the comfort of the car, get out to fill up (yes the app doesnâ€™t do that unfortunately) and thatâ€™s it.
I had the app for a day or two. My account got suspended over a week ago and nobody seems to no why and is able to resolve it.
"Failed on my first attempt to use it. Got the app setup, went to the petrol station and picked pump and amounts and pressed the option to continue. The app got stuck on â€œunlocking pumpâ€, waited for over a minute and nothing happened. I interrupted the process by closing the app. I filled up with Diesel and went in to pay as normal. Iâ€™m glad I mentioned to the staff about the failure to use the app as my card was charged with the amount and they did something to refund me. So no easy way to fill up using an app... not a good experience and have no confidence in this app/system. 
Bye bye â€œBP Meâ€ short life."
Downloaded this app and registered but canâ€™t register my card. Now I am getting a massage that my account is suspended
"Be very wary of this app. I was charged for someone elseâ€™s fuel as well as my own. Luckily I looked at her transactions before I left the station and queried this. Not sure what would have happened if I had not! 

The support for this app were less than helpful, didnâ€™t respond in the 5 days they said they would and had to chase only to be told they hadnâ€™t looked at why it happened. Very poor! Be wary and if you do use make sure you check the transactions history."
Surely you should be able to register your car, then the cameras can pick up the number plat at a pump. The phone would be there too, so the app should just pop up and say â€œdo you want to use BP me at pump 3?â€
Very annoyingly this app. logs you out after 30 days if you havenâ€™t used it . So you end up sitting at the pump trying to remember your password. If you use a strong passwords that isnâ€™t always easy. This is despite having faceID enabled. Complete nuisance- not even my bank/financial apps do this. Complete overkill. Itâ€™s supposed to make paying more convenient not less.
"As has been noted by previous reviews, each time I fill up a Â£100 pre-authorisation is taken from my card. My car takes 50-60 litres and the final cost is unlikely to be anywhere near Â£100. 

Itâ€™s even worse on my daughterâ€™s car which takes 30 litres and which I fill up for her occasionally. 

Otherwise the app is great but tempted to bin it given the above."
"I have used this app a few times and find it very useful, especially in the cold whether I can just fill up and go. 

Only down fall is it always fuels 50p less than I requested. For example if I want to put Â£20 in my tank I should be allowed to fuel Â£20 nothing more or less but it only lets me pump Â£19.50 why? That 50p makes a huge difference !!!"
After verifying the account it canâ€™t log you in and keeps loading the login page. Utterly pointless.
"Enough said in the title.
Will check back later in year for an update following the comment from the developers. thanks!"
"Sheâ€™ll can do it, so can you. 

Get a grip"
Didnâ€™t work with fuel card :(
Really poor on iPhone 6+. The splash screen stays on for far too long telling me itâ€™s BP - I know itâ€™s BP - and it constantly asks for a password. Too slow to be of any real use. The Shell app is far better and it will be the Shell fuel I will use.
I used this almost a month ago. I wanted to fill up so the app took a Â£100 hold, then the next day charged me Â£41 for my fuel. Almost a month later and Iâ€™ve still not got my Â£100 back. The app says it can take up to 10 days... not the case...
"Used this app for the first time today. Requested Â£30 of petrol and the pump cut out off at Â£29.10!! Nothing mentioned about a 90p tax just got using the app! Convenient yes, honest no! Your fuel is expensive enough without BP dipping their oily hand in my pocket while Iâ€™m not looking ðŸ˜¡

***edit*** because I canâ€™t reply to your comment â€œrest assured you will always only be charged for the amount of fuel you receiveâ€...... let me make this abundantly clear. Â£30 was deducted from my bank account and the pump stopped at Â£29.10!!! So.... you lie"
"Saw this app advertised at my local BP and thought it was a great idea.

After going through the rigmarole of setting up an account, verifying my email, adding a payment card, adding my nectar card I was all set.

Turns out the app doesnâ€™t remember you or use touch/faceid. I was sat in my car looking at the log in screen. 

As I value my security I take advantage of my phoneâ€™s ability to create long unbreakable passwords, and they are all different from each other. A consequence of this is I donâ€™t, from memory, know all my passwords.

The app hasnâ€™t been written to integrate into apples keychain (some do) so I would have had to exit the app, go into settings copy the password and go back into the app to log in. Every single time!

Ridiculous oversight- who does your UX sign off!?"
When will fuel cards be available as a payment method???
One Star BP. I was excited by this app and all it promised until I discovered it does not work without WiFi or a data contract. This app needs to function over GPS or BP needs to install free WiFi at their filling stations. Yes, some people have work phones where data is not included. Why can we not use your app?
"Unable to login and I see the payments donâ€™t include Allstar fuel cards. 
Would be better to develop a fully functional app before release."
I have read a previous review, which you answered saying you now take Amex. This doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. App sounds like a great idea but I wonâ€™t use it until my Amex works unfortunately. Let me know when you get that fixed.
"Doesnâ€™t work. Said there was a problem with my card. Called my bank. Card was fine and my details were correct. Unable to leave feedback on the app. So so bad. What an embarrassment. Developers and drawing boards spring to mind. Deleted app.

RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER REPLY:
The card was added fine. There was no problem there. It was when I then tried to use the app that it kept saying there was an issue with the card even though it had been successfully added and verified. I donâ€™t have time to email to find out why your app isnâ€™t working, and get involved in all this rigmarole. I will use a different petrol station."
Worked great twice , then keeps saying password is wrong , reset password twice still says wrong password, good app if it worked, now deleted , 2 stars one for each time it worked
downloaded & registered the app last week and linked my master card without any problem. But when I tried to buy the fuel through app in the nearby BP petrol station, it declined the transaction stating that my bank has declined it. When I called my bank they repeatedly confirmed that the transaction request never reached them.
"At first was excited for its convenience, pump stops automatically when it reaches amount assigned. 
I selected Â£25.00 on app and fuel pumped stopped at Â£24.50 so my account was only charged Â£24.50.
BUT couple days later I noticed on my online banking that thereâ€™s a pending amount Â£25.00, why ? This streamline process isnâ€™t right considering payments were taken immediately from my bank account. For some who pump fuel over Â£100 weekly thatâ€™s a large amount pending overall. Will NOT continue to use app unless they remove streamline process. 
BPme FAQs ðŸ‘‡ðŸ». 
Why is there a pending amount for BP in my bank statement? 
To streamline the process of paying for fuel, BPme completes a check with your bank to confirm that you have the available funds before authorising the pump. The amount you choose to fill up by (or Â£100 if you choose to fill your tank) will be reserved from your balance. But don't worry, you will only be charged for the total amount of fuel dispensed.           
The pre-authorised funds will be released by your bank within a few days when the final amount is processed although in certain circumstances this can take up to 10 days."
"Canâ€™t add Amex. Wonâ€™t use the app unless it will. (Website says it does). 

Canâ€™t even submit feedback through the app. 

â€œThere was a problem submitting feedback/adding your cardâ€. 

Waste of time."
Cannot get past setting my password for a new account. Keeps saying,â€Cannot contain or equal usernameâ€, password is nothing like the username so gave up and deleted app.
Canâ€™t register tried 8 times!!!
Attempted to add an Amex card. Got charged Â£1 x3 whilst unsuccessfully trying to add it. Donâ€™t think I will be using this app any time soon
Used card for first time today. Easy to use, only problem is that I canâ€™t input my nectar card details as app keeps saying that there is a technical problem. Can you help?
Despite typing the right credentials the app gets stuck in â€œLogging you inâ€ and after a while send me back to the main login page without an error message. If the credentials are wrong, it does let me know and canâ€™t move forward. But if theyâ€™re right it just sends you back to the main screen
The app seems like a good idea but as per other reviews I cannot add my Amex card. As such the app is useless to me. Would appreciate this being looked into.
Seriously who wrote this app !
You can not add your bp plus fuel card to this app. When will it be added????
Do not use this app, if you say you want a full tank they take Â£100 and it takes days for what you didnâ€™t use to be put back into your account, unlike Tescoâ€™s that take Â£1 by pay at pump and take the rest 2-3 days later,  compensation would be nice but youâ€™ll have more luck getting blood out of stone
Was alway told you would go up in a fireball if you used your phone next to a petrol pump......take it was all fake news !!
"This app is completely useless and I will not using BP again after all this Shell app is brilliant works every time without any problems.
This app has wasted my time on 5 different occasions and the attendants telling me that I have to pay inside as this method hasnâ€™t worked since it came out .
BP your a load of crap.
Why release a useless app thatâ€™s as useful as pig In a dairy farm?
Avoid this like the plague t"
Canâ€™t add Allstar fuel card
The app doesnâ€™t allow you to use a fuel card, so for those who use a fuel card to fill up company cars the app isnâ€™t useful. Maybe future updates should look to add this in
Used the app once, all worked perfectly I was so impressed. But every time I have been back since I get an error saying my cards been declined. I have spoken to the bank and they have said that itâ€™s not a problem at their end so must be the app.
When I tried to use this, transaction refused after I pressed the start button. Of course I tried again and again . The result was three fraudulent transactions of Â£100 on my credit card, which, thankfully my bank blocked. I will never use this app again.
Fill your car ,  Try to pay by the app,  Then stand in the queue at the till !!!!   Good job I brought an alternative method of payment.
"So I downloaded and setup this App a fresh with my Monzo card. No real issues, sign up is a bit clunky but itâ€™s a one-time thing so hey.

I used the App for the first time the other day. I chose the â€œfill my tank optionâ€ and straight away saw a Â£100 charge to my Monzo card. Bit odd I thought but figured this was a pre-charge that would get amended once Iâ€™d filled.

Instead, however, a day later I was then charged Â£53 pounds! I got straight in touch with Monzo and explained the situation and they (to their credit) refunded me the Â£100 given it was still in a pending state.

When I enquired with Monzo as to what had happened they explained that BP do one of two things;

1. Charge Â£100 then amend that amount a day later (whilst itâ€™s still pending)
2. Charge Â£100 then a day later charge the actual amount (in addition) before refunding the Â£100 7 DAYS LATER!

Needles to say the latter was my experience. So if youâ€™re fine with being overcharged Â£100 each time you use this App then go for it. However, thatâ€™s scandalous in my books, shame on you BP!"
You have to preauthorise the payment and you have to pay for the amount you filled. The company technically charges customer twice and issue refund which will take 7-10 working days to credit back to your account, leaving people with insufficient fund in bank. Iâ€™ve used esso and Asdaâ€™s pay at the pump and they work absolutely fine. Why would BP release such an app knowing their customers are being charged twice.
Not able to use BP fuel card - weird given itâ€™s your own fuel card!??
Canâ€™t add my nectar card. Tried over and over this past few days and all I get is â€˜there has been a technical error, please try again laterâ€™. There is a helpful link at the bottom that says itâ€™s the link to the help line. Nothing happens when you press it. As if itâ€™s drawn on and not a hyperlink at all. Day 3. Iâ€™ve deleted the app
Similar to the shell app but does â€œunlockâ€ the pump quicker which is good. Only annoying this is I chose the full tank option which now means although Iâ€™ve only spent Â£34 Iâ€™ve had Â£100 â€œpre authorisedâ€ from my account so will effectively be missing Â£66 from my bank account for the whole weekend until the system tells my bank how much was actually taken....
"Every time I open the app and try to locate the local store, I get ta network not available message check connection. I can assure you that my network is working as it should be. Currently an app that is useless havenâ€™t used once since installation. Shells app works perfectly fine.

Screenshot taken if needed"
So got the app all set up, payment details set up, Nectar card set up but it all failed in the first attempt.  There I am sitting like a lemon at pump 6 and yet my app says â€œhmmm you donâ€™t seem to be near a petrol stationâ€ ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸   Despite logging out and logging back in again I was still unable to be found (despite having 4G connection) and as the bloke in the Range Rover behind had started up his engine and looked decidedly crabby, I had no option but to grab my bag and pay inside - totally the opposite of what the app intended.  In fact it took longer today than had I not bothered downloading it.  Really disappointed and not sure whether Iâ€™ll risk it again as the angry stares of other customers were too much.  Otherwise the idea is great - just needs to actually work!
Pulled up at the pump and selected the number and twice I got an error to suggest technical issues. I gave up and went into the store to pay. Ridiculous and not worth your time setting up.
All set up.  Sat on Forecourt.  App says I am 3 miles from the garage.  Totally pointless
App loaded and no probs connecting to Nectar. Went to use first time and picked pump 6 at garage with Â£20 selected for amount. App replied saying pump 5 ready for use. Had to reverse and thankfully no one at pump 5 otherwise they would have filled using my Â£20. When filling up the pump only dispatched Â£18.60 of fuel (not the Â£20) even though tank was almost empty before filling up. Garage says it's up to BP to sort it out. Seems to be no garage customer service if you have an issue with App.
I want to buy fuel not stocks and shares. Sign up/log in process was so painful I deleted it. Will stick to paying at the kiosk and avoid toad rage
"Iâ€™ve used the app twice so far, at different BP filling stations. Everything worked as expected, and it just makes life that little bit easier, especially when thereâ€™s a long queue.

Iâ€™ve had a few funny looks from people as I just fill up and drive away. Their loss...... 

The only minor criticism I have is the loading time. I appreciate the various steps the app has to take before I can fill up, but the time it takes is *just* on the frustrating side. Hopefully this will be refined in future updates."
This does not work with a BP fuel card! Why make an app that doesnâ€™t work with your own card service that I can use at the till!
I have tired this app at four different bpâ€™s and not one has worked theres either a error message saying unavailable, no pumps available or just error.
"Selected Â£15 and the pump only filled to Â£14.50 
Yet Â£15 was debited from my bank! 

Doesnâ€™t say anywhere in the app that there will be a charge for paying using the app!"
The guy at the till has the power to stop the transaction, then says "the pumps aren't set up for it, it'll be at least a couple of weeks". Note this is when the 500 nectar points offer ends.
"Selected Â£30, it filled up Â£29.50 which was fine. Authorised Â£30 to leave my account, which was ok, then very quickly took the Â£29.50 payment on the same day. 
Would have been good except a week later the Â£30 payment is still pending, I canâ€™t access that money so have basically paid twice as there is no sign of the Â£30 being released.
Will not use again, I would rather walk into the shop that lose money for unknown amounts of time whenever I get petrol."
the payment system is really bad. instead of a trip to the till, for 10 days they are blocking both the maximum value specified as well as the actual value. for 10 days I payed 120Â£ for a tank. next time, I'm paying by card at the till.
BP ME IS A GREAT APP BUT WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY ADDED PAYPAL LIKE ESSO DID WOUOD MAKE IF MORE CONVENIENT HOPE THEY DO SOON CANT WAIT.
Sees several on the map. But none when choosing Select your station. And canâ€™t find it when on forecourt! Great idea but useless.
This is the third time i have tried to make this app work in a gas station but same tech error it gives. The staff in the station have no clue this app is or what fault it is
The problem is I like to fill my fuel tank to itâ€™s max fill.  Should I be expected to keep guessing the amount needed to complete fill my tank up. Hummm howâ€™s this app going to help me.
Decent app. Does what it says. Paying made easy. Only issue is the invoice. You get an email all nicely laid out for expenses, but not as a pdf attachment. Means printing off the email to claim expenses where a pdf can be attached. Old fashioned. Far better and faster to forward and store a pdf. Business users across the board want this. Non business use doesnâ€™t claim.
"Pretty straightforward to use but just 2 items:
1) it seems to take a very long time to load from opening up the app to being able to add fuel but thatâ€™s not the end of the world
2) having used it 3 times, Iâ€™ve never filled up to the correct amount. The pump seems to stop 50p short of my target amount. Granted, I only get charged the amount I filled (Â£24.50 rather than Â£25) but I canâ€™t understand why it has to stop there...!"
Firstly it fails to work out that youâ€™re actually at a BP garage, and then asks you to select your pump number. St that point it reports s technical error and asks you to pay at the kiosk. Whatâ€™s that point?
The app worked great except it pumped Â£14 when the limit I set was Â£15.  Where did the other Â£1 go?
No matter how many attempts to register the Nectar Rewards Card to this app and, after god knows how many password resets, it just wonâ€™t load. Reluctant to use the app for payment as I will only loose the reward benefits. Come on developers, sounds like thereâ€™s a few hitches going on!
The app is useless, when you register the only option is to change the password and not enter the app. For a company like BP to roll this out is frightening.
Downloaded the app to my iPhone; registered; verified my email; created my password. Tried to login and just ended up in a cycle of returning me to the login page!! Decided to change my password (just in case the password was causing the problem) but still looping back to the login page after attempting to login!!! What a waste of time.
"Tried to use this app on three occasions now. Each time Iâ€™ve had to log in again? Then payment always fails.
Great idea, but just lets you down."
"I was really Looking forward to This BP app so I wouldnâ€™t have to go to the shops to pay every single time I come for some fuel (I drive a lot) 
First time I put fuel in full. With some reason BP took my Â£100 on hold even I spent only Â£54.49 but thatâ€™s happen. However after 3 days I have been charged mentioned Â£54.49 and Â£100 is still (sic!!) on hold. 
I went to put some more fuel and this time I put only Â£20.00 using the app. I was able to put fuel for total of Â£19.50 and guess what. Been charged Â£19.50 with another Â£20 on hold. 
So now I ended up really unhappy, with Â£120 still!!! On hold.
I havenâ€™t deleted app only in case I would have to claim my money back from BP. 

Iâ€™m never going to use your app again, really unhappy."
Needs work. Wonâ€™t accept Nectar password. Wonâ€™t change security question. â€œWhoops, something went wrongâ€
Took Â£100 from my account but only about Â£30 in fuel taken. Then it takes 2 weeks before it goes back into your account. Wonâ€™t be using it again.
Downloaded app only to find you canâ€™t use it on a bike - because phone should be used inside a car - tell that to all the folks chatting away while refuelling or trying to get the app to work while standing alongside their car.  Ridiculous- would be great help to bikers but we are excluded!
Iâ€™ve tried to use the app twice, I get to the point where you enter pump number and it says â€œweâ€™re experiencing technical difficultiesâ€. Nice idea, shame it doesnâ€™t work for me
"Iâ€™ve had and used another fuel app for some time but wanted to add the BP app so I had more choice. 
I found the BP app more difficult to set up, less forgiving if not correct first time and mostly the BP app does not seem to accept PayPal."
Iâ€™m parked sitting next to pump 3 ??
"So having used the Shell app for some time I was excited to try the BP particularly as it links my nectar.

Massive mistake that has cost me considerably, as others state it takes around 5 mins to load the app which is pointless at the pump, quicker going in.  My costly mistake was selecting the full tank option which freezes your bank account to the value of Â£100 (discretely explained in the QA section online) purchased fuel on the 25th, Â£49 come off 27th and today as I type the Â£100 is still in pending transactions, in essence BP have taken Â£149!!! Several direct debits have now bounced due to lack of funds and no where on the app to get it resolved.

My advice unless you want Â£100 frozen out your account for a week (explained again in QA) then do not download!! Shell all the way regardless

Update 29/4 - Barclays have responded stating BP have placed a hold on the funds for 7 days and they are unable to release them as the transaction is guaranteed with a debit card, BP are blaming the bank and despite their own T&Cs stating the hold will be lifted once the transaction goes through I still have no money"
Spent 30 mins setting up the app as thought it was a good idea but it doesnâ€™t save your payment details. Emailed and was told to download a later version but this is the latest version available? Ran out of patience to continue.
Doesnt work, waste of time
Perfect clickable app #freepetty
I saw the app advertised at my local garage, thought it seemed a good idea, downloaded it and used it - no problems, easy to use. However, even though the moneyâ€™s been correctly taken from my account, a week later BP are still holding Â£100 as a â€œpending transactionâ€ against my debit card.  Reading previous reviews suggests this is a known problem which BP have neither responded to nor fixed. I wonâ€™t be using the app again unless this issue is corrected, which is a shame because everything else about the app works well.
Having dispensed Â£41.66 of fuel my bank was debited with both this amount PLUS another Â£100. Two days later it is still in pending transactions and I cannot spend my money. There is no warning of this â€œauthorisationâ€ procedure and is totally unacceptable. This would be really useful for me but I will be deleting the app and going back to petrol stations that do pay at pump without this nonsense.
Try this app payment been declined by bank contacted to bank and they say no transaction was made. Try add credit card same problem...
used couple of times but fuel stops at 50p less and still charges full amount
Why do I get charge twice for single fuel top up?!?!? So basically I needed Â£20 + Â£19.50 on my bank account to put in Â£19.50 worth of fuel. OMG... Iâ€™m still waiting for my money back and will defo not use this app again untill this doesnâ€™t get fixed.
I use BP a lot but this is an awful app. It gets stuck on the start screen and does not allow you to add a payment method as something has apparently gone wrong??? I like the speed of paying by app but will have to use Texaco instead.
Please add Paypal !
The app sounds good however with my iPhone 6 it takes so long to load up I would have drivers behind beeping at me if I stayed stationary in the car waiting for it. Iâ€™m not sure how this is an advance from pay at pump technology.
Bad long winded registration process and then refused to unlock the pump.   Spent 15 mins late at night trying to get fuel and had to give up.   Wonâ€™t be using BP for a while as a result.
Thought it was great to start with until I had nearly Â£200 sat in pending transactions despite the payments for the fuel going out straight away! Had to wait a week for it to go back in! Iâ€™m on a very tight budget and donâ€™t have Â£200 to spare! Really disappointed as the concept is great and I found the app easy to use and quick.
"used this for the first time on 03/05/18 used the FULL TANK option, they â€œAuthoriseâ€ Â£100 from bank account, I filled up, total cost Â£40.52, and 48hrs later thereâ€™s still Â£100 taken from my account!!! Contacted BP Was told weâ€™ve not taken it, itâ€™s just authorised. Thatâ€™s as maybe but Iâ€™m still short of Â£59.48! Called bank was told to contact BP! 100% Not happy. 
ADVISE EVERYONE DO NOT USE THIS APP!"
Thought your not supposed to use mobile phones at petrol stations?? They are always telling you to switch them off ðŸ¤”
If you choose the option to fill up your tank BP will put a hold on your bank account for Â£100 even if you have only used Â£30 and you wonâ€™t get the balance back for at least 5 days
"I got really excited about this app, but I ended up sat in my car at the pump, being told I wasnâ€™t near any BP garages. 
Turns out that one isnâ€™t on their list!
So I thought Iâ€™d search for a closer one to me that is on the list... and the app says yes, my local BP is open right now!
Only problem is, my local BP is closed for months while they redo it!
Disappointed is not the word ðŸ˜¬"
Very fast to set up, easy to use. Almost too easy!!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"The app is a brilliant idea. With my local BP being paired with an M&S I have spent way too long queuing for someone to get their shopping scanned. However, with the two options you have to fill up either fuel tank (authorises Â£100) or your chosen amount it holds the money way too long after youâ€™ve paid for the fuel.

My last transaction had Â£50 missing from my account for 7+ days, wasnâ€™t an issue for myself but could be for others. That is the biggest flaw in this app, if you are thinking of using it account for double the amount you put in or more missing from your account."
Used the app for the 1st time today at my local bp station and it worked fine. Released the pump quickly. It did stop 50p short but I can live with that.
It doesnâ€™t allow me to enter card details despite multiple attempts and no indication as to why not. Have given up.
I need the option to be able to filter the bunker stations only
Iâ€™m sorry but I donâ€™t get all the negativity about this app, downloaded it for the first time yesterday registered set up payment, drove to pump followed instructions and it worked like a dream! Will definitely be using this every time I fill up saves queuing to pay for fuel at a very busy garage.
"Reading the reviews here, people are being a bit harsh. Lovely interface, simple to use and it does work. 

Most definitely a novelty as by the time you mess about on your phone, you could be in and out of the shop but if your filling station is constantly busy youâ€™ll save time.

Only thing I donâ€™t like is the Â£100 pre authorisation which sticks on your account as a pending transaction for longer than Iâ€™d like, however in future Iâ€™ll just pre select however much I want to spend."
This app is totally useless. Tried to use it on 3 separate occasions in the last month and has never worked. Ended up taking twice as long and having to queue and pay in the kiosk anyway.
I was persuaded to download this app by BP and nectar, I went out of my way to a BP station only to find the app wasnâ€™t working and it said to go into the shop to pay for the fuel! Great first experience, think I will stick to pay at pump...
App only allows you to purchase Â£5, Â£10, Â£15 etc up to Â£100. Does not allow you to purchase Â£8 or Â£23 etc so moped or motorcycle users donâ€™t bother. This app also has a 50p buffer which only allows you to put Â£4.50 of fuel if you want Â£5.00. The full fiver leaves your account for it to come back within a period of time which the app lacks to tell you. The app is also pointless. Itâ€™s only been useful to get the 500 extra points on my nectar card for a one time use. Also the nectar points donâ€™t refresh like the nectar app does. Useless app that doesnâ€™t add any substance towards the entire process of purchasing petrol. Maybe a few pence off per litre for long term users would have been a good idea. But BP donâ€™t give me the impression their really fussed about the app. So why should I be?
Useless. Doesnâ€™t explain how to use it. I filled a special fuel can with 15 litres costing Â£20.89 i think. Told it the pump number, then what? It said full tank or Â£15. Well, neither! If you canâ€™t make it self-explanatory I canâ€™t be bothered to use it
"I used the BPme app to fill up fuel in my car. I followed the app instructions and got the confirmation it was ready to fuel and good to go. It stated my email confirmation will be emailed.  

However, I shortly got accused an hour later, around the corner, that I had driven off without paying for fuel. When I advised the member of staff I had paid via the app and took it out to show him, I was presented an error message that stated an error occurred and I should â€˜try againâ€™ or â€˜call usâ€™. 

At no point in your FAQâ€™s or instructions of how the app works, does it state I should go into the app after fuelling to ensure the transaction has gone through. If there is an error, the app should not unlock the pump and advise I am ready to go and will receive an email later. The error message should come through as a notification to my phone, nor should I be allowed to proceed if there is this risk. 

It is extremely unacceptable to be accused of theft and to be told I would have been reported to the police as a drive off, due to your appâ€™s incompetence. If your app is not robust to complete transactions accurately or notify an individual timely of errors then it should not be in use. 

This experience has been completely unsettling and I want to ensure everyone is made aware to steer clear of this app."
Everything went perfect until in settings i press for the touch id,in idea that will work also with face id on iPhone x,but since then i canâ€™t open the app anymore,please fix the issue,i love the app.
A payment method that doesnâ€™t work with your own fuel cards??! What is the point of that?
Downloaded alpp while I was at the petrol station. Added all the personal details required however it could not find my nearest station. 12 hours later it still canâ€™t find it
"There are two problems as far as Iâ€™m concerned. First the app gives static opening times for stations but doesnâ€™t show at a glance which of those on the map are actually open nor anything to alert about closing say in next 30 mins which both of these would be good features.

Second, there are no prices shown against the stations on the map. BP should not get carried away thinking users are insensitive to price. No, with much better fuels these days at the discounters BP needs to work harder on being price competitive. The app should show the prices.

Finally, a disappointment which I thought was rather cheeky is why does fuel cost more if using the App? Fuel should be less for using the App as one hasnâ€™t had to use staff service at the station.

These are three ways BPMe could be improved. BP shouldnâ€™t believe that loyalty is assured just because of the App because it isnâ€™t. BP must earn the loyalty: the ultimate fuels arenâ€™t the sole reason one will buy from BP nice as they are."
When can we use fuel cards please?
I just love beta testing for massive companies.
Pointless app, the find a garage feature doesnâ€™t work , didnâ€™t on the older version either - just get a message saying no network connection (when there is, and location services are enabled).  RUBBISH!
Installed on iPhone X, iOS 11.3.1 and the app doesnâ€™t start and crashes after the initial load screen.
"App crashes as soon as launched
Reinstalled twice but no use
Waste of time"
This app is a great idea to save time etc. However, first time using it after setting up my account, told to fill up via my phone which I start to do only for an error to come up on the app saying â€˜there was a problem something went wrongâ€™. So I tried again with the same outcome. In the end went and paid the old fashion way. Would love the app to work as Iâ€™m all for the tech revolution. However the developers need to sort it out before I attempt to use again.
On the 22nd May 2018, I went to the Bp on Luton Road Dunstable LU5 4LW, eager to try bp.me and get the 500 bonus points on offer. After fill Â£25.31 worth on unleaded I my tank, I went in to explain I was using BPme and try to pay. But the app only allows pounds to be entered and you canâ€™t put in a decimal for pence. I tried using the Fixed option and entering the amount, Â£25. It failed saying it couldnâ€™t unlock the pump. I tried Â£26 and the same thing happened. I then looked into the full tank option, but the small print says they will reserve Â£100from my account, and with so many other customers being charged Â£100 for nothing, my confidence in BPme went down the toilet. To top it off, I went to the bp staff and explained I had problems using BPme and could they help me. All the woman did was sit there gawping with her man mouth open like she at the dentist and then muttered a pathetic â€œuh hu.â€ Followed by a â€œ can you use Apple Pay?â€ Excuse me but what it the point of bp staff recommending Apple Pay when thier app should be their priority!!!! I used a normal chip and pin, with my nectar card of course, and promptly got out of there. I may never use BP petrol again, double points or not. I certainly wonâ€™t use the app. I hope bp retrain or fire this terrible person I mentioned. Good luck to those who have spent with BPme.
Stupid as you have to specify amounts before filling
Having seen this advertised on the TV and at my local garage I decided to give it a go. Having downloaded and set up my account no problem I went to use the system for the third time yesterday. I have come to the conclusion that the app is a good idea and BP are onto something but personally I would prefer that I prepaid into like a wallet within the app and then had the monies deducted automatically rather than having Â£100 frozen on my account. Would also be quite good if you could integrate it into your ANPR cameras at the forecourts so the app deducted monies automatically from you wallet like the congestion charge system in London and send an email when your wallet is getting low. Other than that I think this is a good way and with a bit of work could be faultless and the new way to fill up
"After having successfully setup the app with all my details including payment card I quit the app. 

Now apart from the title screen the app wonâ€™t run and crashes before I even get the chance to try and log in. 

Now you have my payment card details and I canâ€™t get in to delete the details!

Not impressed!"
Not finding nearest station since yesterday
I used this for the first time and spent Â£37. However my bank statement says they have charged me Â£100.  Will not be using it again. Also need to try to get the money back.
iPhone X will not run this app. Crashes on start up every time. The only way I can get it to work is to un install and then re install. Works for the first time, then crashes every time I open the app after that. Useless app. Donâ€™t bother downloading. Only giving it one star as I canâ€™t give it none.
What a fantastic app, take your time to set it up properly and it works it just works.
"I have completed registration but after it initially working the app keeps crashing. Downloaded the app 3 times and still the same poor performance.

Update: I reloaded the app and this time I didnâ€™t enable Face ID. Not it seams to be working."
Keeps on crashing
Itâ€™s really good app but it doesnâ€™t have option to print or download the receipt other then that itâ€™s good
I had downloaded app including all my details for payments etc attended at garage tapped the app and nothing tried several times goes to start front end page then blank screen I have deleted and re entered app it worked for a day went to use at garage nothing again very frustrated does work on my iPhone X
"The App constantly crashes before it even opens fully, canâ€™t get past the loading screen.
Doesnâ€™t deserve a star if honest."
"Developer says we have sort it out but is not still working so what they say is rubbish
AND I READ THE COMMENTS NOW IVE SHIFTING IN PANTS TO USE IT FREEZING Â£100???? His is bad why they can't produce something it does work properly I was in Italy over there technology is great ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’©"
Registration process works well enough but then upon logging in to the app it immediately kicks me back to the home screen every time. Full restart of the phone makes no difference
Everything works until you try to get it to email a receipt which I need for work to claim back my petrol. Tried to change email address but the app does not allow me. Emailed their customer services and they didnâ€™t bother to reply, USELESS
Poor app, has potential but after signing up and putting payment details in, as soon as I open, it bombs out every time on my iPhoneX. Whoever developed this needs firing. Probably not tested on platforms.
I deleted and reinstalled but just crashes every single time I try and open it. Amazing such a large company with billions canâ€™t even make a simple app!!
It wonâ€™t let me log in. Verified my password and email but when I log in it asks security questions and pin then I type it in then it comes up saying this email address is already being used, even though Iâ€™m logging in?
Good, easy to use app but Iâ€™d like there to be an option to download PDF receipts. Or send an email with a PDF receipt. This would help save time with business expenses.
"The app keeps crashing I have to delete and reload before I can use again
 once Iâ€™ve used it I canâ€™t reopen the app"
"I have ASDA master card and it wonâ€™t let me register it, tried several times. 
Looking at the reviews, a lot of people are having a problem with it. Really bad of such big company to launch an app that doesnâ€™t work. A real disappointment"
Initially App could not find my local station. I had to â€˜locate itâ€™ on the stations nearby map. Once that was done the only option it offered me was a route to the petrol station.......400 yards away. Couldnâ€™t â€˜findâ€™ the station when I was in the forecourt. Have tried again since filling up but hit the same problem. Think I will be deleting this one
Every time I open the app it just closes absolute crap or I just donâ€™t wanna give you the 500 points they claim to give you when use it first
"Managed to set up account and validate email, up wonâ€™t even login
So many negative scores, BP are obviously having issues 
I will avoid until fixed"
I used this for the first time today. Got to the pump, selected which pump, selected Â£70 fuel and off I went until the pump stopped at Â£69. My receipt says Â£69 but youâ€™ve charged my AMEX Â£70! I want my money back out of principle!
Was hoping this would let me view petrol prices at different service stations from my phone. It doesnâ€™t. Massive oversight.
App wonâ€™t open keeps crashing waist of time.
Great app, no longer queuing up behind the old man paying for his paper with pennies or the builder with his coffee! My only gripe would be it would be even better if it was integrated with Apple CarPlay
Purchase of fuel was fine, Â£100 came out as expected. Few days later the fuel funds went as expected. Now the problem is I am still waiting for the mo why that wasnâ€™t used on fuel to go back into my account!!! Â£33 stuck is pending! I would like to be able to spend my money please.
"Canâ€™t even get into the app as it crashes every time 

Sort this out please so I can use it!"
After adding all card details it keeps crashing!! iPhone X recently updated
"App doesnâ€™t work. Just fuelled and had to pay in the store because the app couldnâ€™t unlock the pump so they had to do it manually!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR RELY ON THIS APP"
Still donâ€™t work, so annoying â€œsorry there has been a problemâ€!! Sent report off to Apple as I am a beta tester on iPhone X. Did work initially despite having contacted the BP help number and having my details deleted still no joy.
Used the app twice without a problem, tried to use it again a week ago but this time a login was required. Message said â€œ sorry there was a problem please try again â€œ 6 days on and still not able to login, very disappointing.
Works perfect for me and saves waiting in shop to pay, nice touch linking Nectar card into app as well, was a bit nervous first time I used it incase people thought I was driving away without paying.
Latest update is crap canâ€™t log in anymore
I would love to use this app but it is not compatible with Santander cards. Pity
This is surely the worst app ever created by anyone let alone a global multi-billionaire, no resources spared company! Atrocious, unreliable and simply non workable app specially given that Shell is far more reliable and works without any glitches. Guys and gals letâ€™s vote with our phones by taking our business elsewhere. We clearly arenâ€™t that important to BP if they canâ€™t even get an app functioning properly. It only took them decades to perfect it before launching such abysmal app. Disappointing isnâ€™t the word I would use.
â€œSorry something went wrongâ€ after I attempt to login; probably wouldnâ€™t trust it to do something more complex like actually get me a tank of fuel based on this...
So bad that Iâ€™m writing another review. First off, this app shouldnâ€™t be constantly asking me to log in with email/password and then security questions - as it did tonight, first time Iâ€™ve used it after the latest update. Secondly, this new â€˜Â£100â€™ reserved in the bank... whatâ€™s that about? Totally puts me off using the app altogether. Again, I gave up and paid for my fuel in the kiosk. Any response to this feedback, BP?
Tried to use it in Scarborough and it didnâ€™t work. People behind tills say they have been waiting for it to be fixed for ages. Now no bonus Nectar points as no other near me.
App set up seemed to go fine. However now every time I try to use it, the app will not let me log in and keeps repeating a stupid little pop up stating â€œOops, something went wrongâ€. Iâ€™ve tried all the usual things. So app is about be deleted for good. This type off app is not a new idea. Another fuel provider has an app that works well. Ill be sticking to that one, then.
Have registered and canâ€™t get in to app. â€˜Something went wrongâ€™. Thought this was a good idea but canâ€™t even use it!
I really liked this app until I got an iPhone X and the app kept crashing. But now itâ€™s fixed and all good again!
"This app is a good idea as I often have my children in the car so not having to go and queue to pay would be a huge benefit saving time getting the children out of the car just to go and pay, however, my car takes less than Â£40 to fill the tank and having a Â£100 hold put on my funds until the transaction clears isnâ€™t ideal for me, will choose a specific amount next time instead of the full tank option. 

The 1st time I went to use this app the transaction was declined. My bank contacted me the next day to verify if it was a genuine transaction made by me. Having confirmed this, I gave the app another go. This time I selected to fill up with Â£40 instead of selecting full tank. No problem, my tank was full just before reaching the Â£40 and the transaction was swift and painless. There is a funds hold on the amount selected (which is released a few days later and the amount spent at the pump is then taken). All in all a good app and certainly beneficial to me when I have the children"
"Used a few times and was great till one day when I opened it to put Â£41 got to the confirming payment the app said error.  No money taken and to try again. I did this 3 times and on the forth it got to the unlocking pump.  So jumped out the car started feeling.  It went past the Â£41. I suddenly stopped went back to my phone and it said a error had occurred and to pay in shop.  I panicked as had no money or cards. Went into the petrol station to tell them.  I remembered I had wallet on the iPhone X. Took me 5 mins to work out how to pay as I was in a nervous panic and forgot how to use my phone. 
Anyway I got home and checked my bank and just under Â£200 had to reserved out my bank.  Â£254 from the attempted BPme app. 
I messaged the BP people they wanted nothing to do with it. But was going to look further into it. I got a new message a few days later telling the the staff didnâ€™t know what they was doing and was pressing the wrong thing in the shop. 
Well thatâ€™s still no help to me. Iâ€™m Â£154 down now and the money still hasnâ€™t been released 4 days later. 
Iâ€™m not using this app no more.  Itâ€™s not trustworthy.  Oh and the fact if you press full tank.  My tank hold about Â£50.., the system takes Â£99 out."
Slower than going in and paying normally.
Uploaded app and set off for local BP station. Super it worked a treat. However next time it didnâ€™t, I had no other means of payment and not enough fuel to get home. Manager lent be enough to buy a little. Returned next day, app still not working. Again today. Useless ðŸ˜•
"The app does not allow you to login.
I have contacted BPme about this, given them time stamps when it fails to login, no response..
Might try Shell."
"First you select the app
Let it boot up
Unlock with fingerprint 
Let it boot up some more
Pick your pump
Let it sort itself out
Pick how much you want to pay
Wait a bit for it all to settle and register
Fill up and go

To be honest it would sometimes be quicker just to walk in and pay. Great idea but needs a bit of tuning to avoid me having to sit in my car like a doughnut while waiting to fill up."
"I used this app without a problem until a recent update whereby when I fill up a full tank they take a pre auth amount of Â£100 (when selecting a full tank) or the amount in which you input when selecting the volume you wish to fill up with I.e. select Â£50 and theyâ€™ll take Â£50 as a pre auth.

For example Â£100 was taken as a pre auth + Â£85 the amount I filled up; this meant Â£185 was taken in total and I am yet (4 days later) to have my pre auth amount back."
BPMe should add PayPal cars is not only the greatest options hence not using the app shell fill up and go better or esso
Not working on iPhone X,canâ€™t login,must fix
"Useless. Doesnâ€™t work for me at all.

I just get a â€œSomething went wrongâ€ error. No code, no link to support, no idea. I had to go online to find a way to report this bug. Utterly useless.

I work on large scale apps myself, Iâ€™d have never approved this."
"I used the app a couple of times to fill up and it was great. Now though whenever I attempt to sign in it says oops something has gone wrong. I have deleted and reinstalled the app and still have the same error. Only started to tolerate the high prices at BP due to the convenience of the app. 

Wonâ€™t be using BP anymore."
Sadly every time there is an app update or software update, it will NOT work with iPhone X.  Very poor!!!
"The promise of paying for my fuel by app sounded interesting.

The reality of a poorly written app less so. 
I couldnâ€™t even get successfully logged in, the error helpfully points out that â€œsomething went wrongâ€ and to try again. I did try, numerous times. How many tries should I give it? How should I get help?

If I canâ€™t login to the application with ease, what hope should I have that I can actually pay for fuel with the app and have that go well?

Good idea, but in my opinion could use a bit of wax and polish."
Tried to use for the first time, transaction apparently declined by bank. Went into garage and paid with the same card Iâ€™d registered with with no problem at all. Called bank who confirmed that there had been no transaction declined at their end and that it has to be an application or BP system problem. Current confidence in system? Zero.
Tried twice once for 20mins and it wouldnâ€™t even let me log in my local bp is also a Marks and Spencerâ€™s so you have to queue with people doing a weekly shop. Though this would be the answer but clearly itâ€™s not a lady next to me had the same issue
"Sure itâ€™s a great app but every bank/credit I try, it just says thereâ€™s a problem with your card! Tried 4 different ones, Visa, Visa debut & MasterCard ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼

27/06 edit: Has deleted and reinstalled the app (again) itâ€™s now accepted the MasterCard ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
"Poor app, twice now the app has failed after â€˜unlockingâ€™ the pump, app up to date, bank details correct and funds available.

Pump starts i fill up and then get accused of not paying. 

Reading other reviews it appears this is a common problem"
"I fill up regularly using a fuel card, every couple of days. Without being able to accept fuel cards through the app I canâ€™t use it, shame.
Is this coming in the future?"
Needs more consistency otherwise this app is useless.... ive had the app since day one... i fill up with fuel weekly and ive only managed to use the account 6-7 times.... majority of times theres an issue... never an issue with my bank! SORT IT OUT BP!
The station near my house Rainbow Services in forest road has had the BPme enabled for couple weeks now and every time I try to use the app the app tells me the bump is unlocked but never actually works. The app seems useless for some reason.
"Does not allow you to pay for the fuel you have used.

Only allows prepayment like at normal pay pumps.  Better hope you select the correct pump and are you sure you will not be paying for the previous or next driver?"
Used the app successfully 3 times. Then it forgot my password and I had trouble logging in. Had error message each time I tried to log in. Now as soon as I hit â€˜log inâ€™ I get â€˜Sorry, something went wrong, please try againâ€™. Such a shame as when it worked it was effortless.
"The reserved amount is now sorted !
Thank you !
But this app is still the slowest !
I use all similar apps on the market, as I fill up from all major brands, but this app is the slowest, from a distance !
When trying to use the app, I noted that Iâ€™ve been logged off !
I had to take the whole process of logging on, including the secret question, while Iâ€™m using a touch-id device ?!
Dear developers, please step into these issues !
I would like next time to give a five star review !"
"It worked once , and then never again. 
Really disappointed as I loved the idea"
Worked once or twice , it was awesome . Then never ever worked again, actually takes more time messing about with the app. I love apps like this so I would use it every time , especially as it automatically adds nectar points  but itâ€™s unreliable . Please sort it out because it ends up infuriating me and leaves me feeling negative towards your brand .
I filled up at pump yesterday and selected Â£40 option.The pump locked at Â£39.50. I checked my     Bank Account and it shows a Â£40 pending transaction on my statement.Does this mean I will be shortchanged by 50p every time I fill up using the BPme app?
"Updated from me on 14th July 2018 .
Youâ€™re still missing the point , if you fill up (For example) 4 times in one week it still takes a total of  Â£400 out of your bank account then will over 10days to correct the payment and pay the money back .. 
other big companies company such as Asda and Tescoâ€™s check your bank card for payment and only charged Â£1 .

I would not recommend this app to anyone stay clear .. 

The developer really should work on this and stop trying to brush over the situation."
If this appâ€™s purpose is to make it quicker and more convenient for purchasing fuel it has failed to both fronts. I canâ€™t even pass the log on screen, currently all I am getting  is the white box with the green circle. I managed to fill up, queue, pay at the kiosk and get back before it even loaded the log in screen - which is still spinning. Needs a lot of work
When you can get logged into the app itâ€™s great but most of the time it doesnâ€™t work you are on the login screen trying to log in, you are quicker to go in to the garage and pay yourself. Too many bugs to get sorted out.
Hey
Cannot get APP to accept payment details- tried 3 cards. Hopeless.
The app is not working every time I try to login it says; sorry something went wrong please try again later
"This new version asks for a pin, I reset it and no matter what I do it fails.
Poor"
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. Every time I try to use this rubbish I have a problem. Managed to pay for fuel once. Itâ€™s locked my card several times then wouldnâ€™t pick up the station I was sitting in and now I have tried changing my pass code 5 times and still canâ€™t get in.
"I pretty much only use the app now.

I understand the pre-authorisation thing is a pay@pump type limitation to stop people going with basic accounts going overdrawn.

Iâ€™ve not hit seen any issues with the preauthorisation like others complain, however given the ever increasing price rises the Â£100 â€˜full tankâ€™ is about 90% of a tank for a VW T5 Van with Ultimate Diesel.  Perhaps there is a way that this could be increased? Maybe default to Â£100 but let me override it to a high value?

As a side note itâ€™s saved me a fortune by not queuing next to the chocolate."
Terrible. Was looking forward to see how it worked. Tried to use it twice over a a couple of days and got same message back in app saying they had some technical difficulties and to try again ðŸ˜¤ðŸ¤¬
The last update killed an app that was full of bugs. Canâ€™t get logged in no matter what now. Idea was good and worked occasionally. I will leave it a while before I try again, hope they sort it out
Iâ€™ve been using this app for two months and itâ€™s been excellent and convenient until now. My Face ID has stopped working on the app and my pin code wonâ€™t work even after resetting a number of times. I called customer services only to be told that the app doesnâ€™t work very well with the iPhone X. They told me to delete my account and set another up if I want to keep using it and all my historical data will be lost and is unrecoverable. What a joke that big companies like BP canâ€™t get a basic app to run properly. If you need all your fuel data to be kept secure and accessible at your fingertips donâ€™t rely on this application be warned !!!
"After spending quite a while setting the app up I decided to use it with child in car to save me bringing him into the filling station and queuing up.  Long story short, the app failed after I filled up with Â£50 fuel. 
I phoned customer service through the app, but as it was evening, they were closed !!!
I  had to go into the station, explain the situation and  arrange to call back and pay later (as Iâ€™d come out with no wallet).  
No thanks BP...
Icing on the cake.. After returning to the garage and paying the Â£50 cash my debit card shows not one, but two Â£50 transactions from the BP app.
I will be deleting this rubbish app for definite.. I canâ€™t recommend it one bit."
Used the app quite a few times successfully, it now seems after an update I canâ€™t access as it as it says â€œincorrect pinâ€ reset the pin twice... still the same message. Frustrating. Was at a fuel station, no wallet and unable to refuel.
"The vast majority of poor reviews are because the users are rubbish, not the app. 

In my experience it is a very good, slick and easy to use app. 

Well done and thank you BP."
"Dear 500pd developers, you must have introduced pin to make my touch-id-locked phone even more locked, that's ok. 
What is not ok is that pin screen won't let me into the app even after a reset of the pin. Please fix this blocking bug."
Very poor
"Iâ€™m afraid to say that after using your app successfully at the start, I now think it is rubbish, poorly developed, poorly tested and poorly supported. Let me explain why I think this way and hopefully you can get me working again:

I have 3 occasions when the app would not function properly and I had to pay by credit card in the shop. One one occasion the pump would not unlock. On two occasions, after an app update I think, I could not get access for a while. Today I can still not get access.
When I start the app I am asked for my pin. Well I was using Face ID on my iPhone X so I donâ€™t know what pin was being asked for. I tried a few pins, but they all failed. It seemed like I could make as many attempts as I like - surely a security risk.
There is a Forgot Pin option, which is badly positioned on the iPhone X making only just possibly to touch.
I did this, got the link on my email, reset my pin and tried again in the app. No luck. Tried this several times more and the new Pin was not recognised.
Called your support number in your email and was told office closed.

If you want to roll out new technology, please get it right - every time.

Can you fix this or shall I just move over to Tesco where the app does work?"
"In using BP Me app - I selected pump 3, entered an amount of Â£35, you gave me Â£34.50 in fuel... You owe me 50p. If you would refund that back into my account as soon as please.

Update: despite what the developer has mentioned below, I was overcharged for the fuel delivered compared to what was taken from my bank account, which can be verified... Would reduce to a negative rating if I could!"
Hi, upgraded to v2.3 and the app now keeps asking for a pin, tried to reset it but it still doesnâ€™t work. Shame, because prior to this upgrade the app worked quite well and I used it all the time - can you fix this bug please!
Upgraded my phone, when I log in it asks for make of first car - enter info - error pops up something went wrong!! No way to access my details or reset this function!
"When you donâ€™t have supported version of app for IOS why do you launch ? 
Contacted customer support mentioned my issue and the lady over the phone was happy to delete the app from my phone not bothered at all for losing a customer."
stopped accepting PIN on iphone after recent IOS update.  bp haven't fixed it in days.
Works like a dream!
Fantastic app, easy to use and speeds up time spent fuelling. Would highly recommend to anyone that is in a hurry or wants to beat the queues in store!
Absolutely rubbish. Live 50 yds from a station on the map. Says unable to find a station near you!. As a wheelchair user would have been a great idea.
"EDIT: Deleting the app and reinstalling then logging back in worked. Thanks for the help. 

For months this app was brilliant. Then suddenly issues started. After filling the app said there was an issue with payment and to go in store. Once inside the assistance said payment had all gone through ok. Now itâ€™s suddenly asking for a pin when Iâ€™ve never given a pin. So I follow the link to reset my pin via email. Enter a pin. Go back to the app... and it doesnâ€™t recognise my pin! Iâ€™ve tried loads of times and nothing!"
"I have been using the BPme app since June, and I absolutely love it! The set up was straight-forward and I no longer need to remember to take my Nectar card with me each time when I pay.
 
The biggest benefit to me as a driver, is the convenience of paying from your car, especially when you are at a busy garage and in a hurry. The BPme app has definitely saved me time at my fuel stops. 

I was unable to use BPme on one occasion when the search could not find my location. I received a polite message on the screen to advise BPme was not available at that garage yet, no big deal to me.

A couple of times it did appear to be slow to find the garage location, but I wonder if that is more to do with the connectivity from the mobile phone network provider than the actual app?
 
As another reviewer commented, it is of significant benefit when you have babies / children with you as it saves either the decision to leave them in the car, or the hassle of having to take them with you to pay.
 
Amusingly, I have received strange looks from people on a couple of occasions, who I can only assume think I am driving off without paying!

I would definitely recommend BPme!"
The latest upgrade does not work with IPhone 8. Very poor
"Worked a few times.  Now â€œsomething went wrongâ€ on login.  Not worth the effort to fix so unless bp see this and fix pronto I will not use again.  Attempts to reply to their emails result in mail delivery failure.  

Annoying.  It could have been good."
This has got to be the worst app Iâ€™ve ever used. So many bugs! Canâ€™t even log in now. Iâ€™ve deleted it and reinstalled but still throws an error. BP should be ashamed putting this out there and the developers should consider a career change! How can you release this and apple how are you approving this app?
Go through the steps to set up and account, confirm the email address - head back to the app to log in and â€œERRORâ€ ... go back to the web page â€œERROR - your password is now invalidâ€. Set a new password, go back to the app and itâ€™s the same story all over again. Useless app.
"Nice idea to have an app which saves you having to queue up behind
People buying groceries or lottery tickets. However it takes ages to login and get to the point when you can fill up. Also this evening it isnâ€™t working at all. Had to do a full login instead of fingerprint or PIN and now I just get message â€˜there has been  problemâ€™ called support but theyâ€™ve closed and shut for the day!  A very poor â€˜Customer Journeyâ€™"
What a load of crap! Not fit for purpose!!!! Down load the Shell app cos that works great
Itâ€™s a great app... when it actually works. It becomes frustrating when you end up on occasions spending more time seeing the â€œsomething went wrongâ€ message and trying to use the app than walking in and paying for the petrol at the counter. Currently not working at all for me even after deleting and reinstalling it wonâ€™t let me log in or even get to the section that asks me to. Had great potential but at this rate will just be deleted.
Tried on several occasions to log in through the app bit says â€œsorry something wrong, please try againâ€
"The app is a great idea, but similar to other reviews works sporadically at best. 

Currently not working at all. When I click log in (why does it keep logging out in the first place) I get the â€œSomething went wrong, try againâ€.

Have closed the app, reset it, deleted and redown-loaded   No difference. 

Worse than useless, as the time at the pump trying to fix it, I could have already filled up and gone..."
App crashes on attempting to load on iPhone X. Not a patch on the Esso app that does the same thing. Please fix!
Just downloaded the app. Finally managed to create an account after several attempts receiving the same error message.  When the account was finally created, email verified then tried to log in.  No luck!  Same error message. Wow! Doesnâ€™t get any worse as first customer experience... I am off to Shell!
Logged me off... Now doesn't recognise my password despite resetting it twice
"Set the app up with all my details, used once fine. Went to use for the second time about a month later and the app doesnâ€™t recognise the same phone. 
Saving time filling up takes twice as long trying to login to the app and then having to give up and pay the old way."
Just says â€˜something went wrongâ€™ each time. Useless.
I could not make it work ever. â€œSomething went wrong â€œ all the time.. very frustrating!!!
"Every time I try and use it I have to log in (user name and password - no face recognition).  Even then it often doesnâ€™t work.  Today for example sat there trying to log in at BP Shepperton,  gave up and filled up normally, asked when paying if BPme was working and staff said â€œoh no, it worked for about a week when they first installed it- never sinceâ€.  Nice idea, useless execution.

Now when I try and log in all I get is the message â€œsorry something went wrong please try againâ€.  Deleted and reinstalled the app and same message."
Itâ€™s really hit and miss with the app, sometime you can fill your car with no problems and sometimes you canâ€™t even get the bp app to load correctly with all there error messages
"This app has huge potential, BUT, if you cannot rely on it to work there is little point in having it. Sometimes connects sometimes not, sometimes have to re log in, but then an error. Finger print log in switches itself off and have to keep resetting pin code, if I get that far.
All in all if it works, brilliant, but the times it has failed far far exceeds the times it has worked.
I am not the only person having problems, yet there never seem to be any updates, so obviously they are not trying to sort out the problems. Such a shame."
Logged me out try to get back in keeps saying opps something went wrong itâ€™s useless
The app was great and very handy, however itâ€™s now logged me out and I can no longer log in. Especially annoying as you find out once youâ€™ve pulled up to the pump!
Easier and faster to pay in cash
Really smooth and easy when it decides to work but usually get a warning saying come â€œbank has declined paymentâ€ for no reason or get the â€œOops something went wrong, please try againâ€ when trying to log in.
Terrible app. Enabled Touch ID - Doesnâ€™t work. Nine times out of ten I log in to a â€˜Sorry, something went wrongâ€™ message. Just a terrible app. Shell and Esso have their apps developed perfectly, how BP can come up with such a bad app is beyond me.
I have only successfully used the app once out of four attempts now! I am required to log in every time with username and password - it should only do this if you do not use it for a long period. Once logged in it then throws an error - try again later! What use is that at a petrol pump !!!!!
Iâ€™ve probably managed to use this twice. When it worked it was great however more often than not I get a â€˜Sorry something went wrong pop upâ€™. Shame really because this could give Shellâ€™s app a run for its money if it worked reliably
Valid username an password â€˜oops something went wrongâ€™. I know the credentials are correct as they work on web UI!
Always have to login again, and then has a tendency to show error that something went wrong try again!!!!
"After using the app twice last week tried using it again today only to be told something has gone wrong and now canâ€™t even get to the log in stage.
If you wish people to use this app it really needs to be trustworthy and fast 
Otherwise I may as well just do it the old fashioned way and walk in to the shop (god forbid as I alway come out with some sort of food I donâ€™t need or want! Maybe thatâ€™s your plan I donâ€™t know) 

Anyhow will this be sorted soon as I like the look on peoples faces who do not know about the app thinking Iâ€™m running off without paying 

Thanks"
More often than not the app doesnâ€™t work. Itâ€™s a great concept, but just needs the investment to be a success
Downloaded the app and registered.. now I canâ€™t log in for the first time. A lot of effort for an app from a company of this size should be a lot better.
Great idea but just doesnâ€™t work. Never ending stating oops something went wrong! Compare it to Shells - that always works! Invest in the app dev BP
"It has been giving error try later when trying to log in for the past month with iPhone 7.
It only worked once 2 months ago.it did this after the last upgrade."
"Something went wrong - please try again.

Need I say more !

Have a BP card , so you would assume as a loyal customer the app would work for us first, but no the last payment method accepted. So when this was announced I tried to set myself up and all I get is the above message."
I use BPme every time I fill up- so quick and easy and back on the road in no time.
A great little app, really saves time when thereâ€™s a big queue in store and all you need is fuel. Essentially itâ€™s BPâ€™s answer to pay at pump, and allows you to collect nectar points too!
"It signed me out and wonâ€™t let me log in again. Keeps saying oops something went wrong. Iâ€™ve tried changing password etc. Nothing
Update - NOW SORTED"
Much faster all round than other fuel buying app Iâ€™ve used for several years. Straightforward to select payment options for max amount or a full tank. Does require a pre-authorisation against your card before filling up.
I have been happy using this app but lately I could not get it to work very frustrating
Great idea. If it actually worked! Been using the Shell version for some time and it is great so completely understand how good it can be. But this is worse than useless. Log in using my 4 digit code. Doesnâ€™t recognise code. Hit forgotten pin link (which is about 70% hidden by the pop up numeric keypad and extremely hard to actually press). Send a reset email. Change passcode. Renter passcode in app. App doesnâ€™t recognise new passcode. And repeat the process again  and again until I completely give up. BPme developers - this is the most basic and simple issue. Can you seriously not get this right...??!! Very very poor
Havenâ€™t used the app yet to pay for fuel but tried to change my email address & it doesnâ€™t seem to be possible - I can change my name but email address is greyed out!! Surely I donâ€™t have to re-register..?!??
App doesnt work...
By the time you get into the app you could have paid at the counter
When installed the App on my other phone it locked my account and told me to call customer care. Unfortunately this service is only available during the week 9 to 5. Ridiculous, as as I like others will fill up my car outside of those hours. Ready to just give up on this.
Every time you try to activate a pump your account is charged that amount of fuel that you want even if donâ€™t get the pump to work . Four attempts at Â£40 (Â£160) charge on my bank account and takes a week to get YOUR money back . A waste of time and effort.
This is a great app, especially when you donâ€™t have much time. I pulled up, opened the app, selected the pump, filled up and went - easy! It also supports my fuel card now which means I can use it for work trips also ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Can't even get past the registration page. Adding my Amex and keep getting this error. Yet each time I try Â£1 is held on my card (and seems BP are using PayPal to process) so is obviously working. Poop.
"I have had this app a while now and itâ€™s great to see it developing and getting better and better with every update. 
Love that I can now use my Fuel card :)

So simple to use and when I have the kids in the car it is saving me money as I donâ€™t have to take them in the shop and spend a small fortune on sweets!!!"
A real time saver!
Never remembers your login details and even then doesnâ€™t work. As if BP donâ€™t have enough money to fix it
The speed of the pump is greatly reduced when using the app to pay.
Iâ€™m an HGV driver. I have a BP fuel card.My company pays for the fuel I use. I donâ€™t want to register any of my details with BP. All I want is to be able to find Fuel sites that can handle HGVs. I could do this quite easily with the old App . I canâ€™t do this with the new App. So it is totally useless from my point of view. I only gave it one star because I couldnâ€™t give it none.
An excellent App and great that BP are making their customersâ€™ lives easier as well as listening to feedback.  I suspect that the frustrations reported about funds reserved on cards are to do with banking payment systems (that have to safeguard cardholders, merchants and banks) and not the App.  Looking forward to the next release.
A great solution for a quick fill without having to queue.
The BPme app is so quick and easy to use. It really helps to avoid the queue at the till and emailed receipt is alot easier when I do my expenses.
Have now started using the BPme app in conjunction with the BP fuel card. So I win with the discounted fuel and I now donâ€™t have to queue to pay for my fuelðŸ˜€ðŸ‘
Fantastic app, loving the ability to now pay on my bp fuel card. Speed, ease and nectar all rolled into one, well done BP!
"I have to say this is an awesome App to have....even better that I can now use my BP fuel card with it.
From a work perspective it keeps me moving and saves delays not having to go into the kiosk to pay....from a personal perspective I have a 4 year old and leaving him in the car on his own is really something I don't like doing so the fact I don't have to leave my vehicle gets a massive thumbs up from me!!! 
I think the App is very intuitive and very easy to use......."
Buying fuel is a time consuming chore and worse is then having to go into the shop to pay. This makes the process so easy and painless itâ€™s now something I look forward to. Telling all my friends and family to download. Try it today!
Like all new apps it takes time, I now only use BP apart from using the app, which now works a treat, I like the super diesel so well done.
Great - often have my dog in the car, so this app makes it so much easier to fill up, pay and go! Happy dog = happy me :)
"Keeps crashing and locking out
Developers fix it which lasts a week then crashes again and again. Useless"
Brilliant, just the job when time is tight or the weather foul. Very convenient when I have the grandchildren aboard, they donâ€™t have to be left on their own while paying in the shop, but on the down side it stops my excuse to browse the shop shelves!!!!
How convenient is this app. Saves time and no more dragging children into the store . Perfect when children are asleep on the back seat. Well done Bp.
I used the app once, it worked fine. I then updated it tried to log back in and was shown a message saying your account was suspended ? I tried to call the number but the office was closed ?? Not much good if your trying to use the app?
Whilst the app works, it needs work. The whole process is slow, so that it takes longer than getting out and paying the cashier! Or is that the fault of the slow Wi-fi connection in each service station. Speed the software and this will be great.
Poor app.
I was using the Shell Driver app, until I went on holiday and found the nearest Shell station was 14 miles away. So downloaded the BP app as the there are always BP stations where ever you are. Unfortunately I have been unable to use the app as I get a message that it can not connect and I should pay in store. (And donâ€™t come back with I had a bad connection as my phone was connected to my car and that has 4G LTE) not only that but itâ€™s so slow, that buy the time I got to the point of the app deciding it wasnâ€™t going to work it would have been quicker to pay normally. It did prevent my dog eating the interior of my car though, my wife got so fed up of waiting she took him for a walk in the park opposite the petrol station! Time to go back to Shell I think! Maybe BP could contact them for help on debugging this pathetic app! Theirs works very well.
Login is too long winded. I can get into my Paypal account with my thumb print but this app requires email, password AND motherâ€™s maiden name.
"Dear BP, top app - definite advantages (I) no longer need to take baby into store (ii) saves money on chocolate etc (iii) saves calories on the former (Iv) saves time queuing. Worked perfectly first time.

Dears users, (I) please select an amount you will be happy to have pre-authorised on your account. E.g. if you want to spend Â£47 pick Â£50 and then fill up to Â£47. If you pick â€œfull tankâ€ they pre-authorise Â£100 (ii) some BP stations donâ€™t take the app - you can see them on the map in the app. The ones that do have the little mobile icon next to them."
"Drive in, fill up, leave. Does what it says, no queues, no fuss. Ok so thereâ€™s a minute or so as you open the phone load the app and it identifies where you are, but a godsend for those with kids who fight in the car when you are in the shop, or when time is at a premium. 

Iâ€™m a fuelcard user, and now get the benefit of recording mileage and getting nectar points as these are automatic and I donâ€™t have to remember mileage figures in the queue as they can be added at the time of opening app. 

Nicely built and intuitive app a huge step forward in the dull task of filling up the car."
"I setup app and added a credit card. 

About 1 hour later I got call from credit card company saying they had declined a Â£0 transaction from PayPal, and asking me if this a genuine transaction

I said no as I had not used PayPal and certainly not for Â£0

Credit card numbers had to be cancelled and new cards issued. 

An absolute pain as this means I have had to update cad details with loads of retailers etc. 

It is only a few days later that through google I have found that BP app uses PayPal for their card services, so this PayPal Â£0 transaction was probably BP verifying card details entered in the app. 

If BP app had actually told me this at the point of entering cad details I would have been able to confirm the Â£0 PayPal was genuine. 

So in summary, BP for me is NOT for me. 

0 stars"
"Each time you draw fuel using this app BP will â€˜holdâ€™ Â£100 from your bank account. BP donâ€™t actually take the Â£100 but a Â£100 hold is made in your bank account so itâ€™s Â£100 less you can actually use.  Youâ€™ll receive the Â£100 back minus obviously the cost of the fuel you have purchased in 5 to 10 days! I have 3 cars and a motorcycle in my household. I had 5 outstanding balance returns totalling over Â£370! Itâ€™s a great app but I would only ever use it if I forgot my wallet etc. I recommended to my friends before I realised and they are cursing me. If your on a budget you could get yourself in to financial difficulties. BP need to have the ability ONLY to take the cash that we draw down for fuel. Iâ€™ve started to use the specific amount option. Can BP tell me why the petrol stops being released prior to the amount
I have selected? Sometimes itâ€™s only 50p sometimes an odd amount such as Â£1.27 short? My tank isnâ€™t full so
I donâ€™t understand why it stops short?"
And the card scanner doesnâ€™t work and you canâ€™t use Apple Pay
"Great app which is simple to use and useful features. Easy to set up too ....

I have a 300 mile weekly commute so buy plenty of fuel and anything to reduce queuing when you only want fuel and just to get on is fine by me!

Only down side is the odd person definitely thinks youâ€™re doing a runner when you just get in your car and go!"
Every time. For any amount. Card always declined. Bank no idea. No use to me. Still have to go and pay with the same card at the till.
Should advertise the price of fuel for each petrol station. Help people save those extra pounds. Just a thought.. other than that I love the app love how I can use my nectar card on it too and keeps me updated about latest offers
Good idea but donâ€™t work.Last time could not unlock the pump (I tried on 2 pumps 6-7 try)
"Just tried local station listed as BPme enabled - It isnâ€™t. After waiting ages staff came out to tell me to pay in the store, and said this app has never worked here
Launceston"
How can it take a company this size so long to add Apple Pay?! Shell have had it for months now. I refuse to enter my card details into an app like this
"Donâ€™t waste your time with this app, set it all up, went to fuel station couldnâ€™t find station! Even though I was sat next to the pump!
Donâ€™t release if it doesnâ€™t work!"
"Please allow us to pay via Apple Pay.

Shell allows you to pay for petrol via Apple Pay and that's why they have now got me as a customer. As soon as you guys add support for Apple Pay I'll be back at BP. 

To be honest, I don't know why you wouldn't incorporate a method of payment that's integrated into all relatively new iPhones and is easy to use."
"App is always playing up I drove off thinking I paid and it had failed luckily the garage didnâ€™t call the police 
I had to drive then but had to go back 2 hours later and pay at the counter 
I called customer service and it was some bloke on other side of world that couldnâ€™t help me or wouldnâ€™t listen to what I was trying to say."
This app is so easy to use & very convenient when youâ€™re in a hurry! It saves you queueing & works perfectly every time I use it. Best thing about it apart from the speed & efficiency is that you can still collect your nectar points! Worth a download!
"BPme really is steps ahead of any other petrol company with this new app. Its great if like me you are always on the go, donâ€™t have time to wait in a queue behind customers with baskets/trollies full of shopping or you have small children in the car who you are reluctant to leave on their own! Literally, some days being able to pay for my fuel through this app has cut about 10 mins off my time compared to coming into the shop. 
The app has great features like still being able to collect nectar points, is compatible with fuel cards and it has a location map to tell you where your nearest station is! Handy!!"
I hate filling my car with fuel so I leave it till Iâ€™m running on fumes! That means Iâ€™m always in a rush when I do get round to it. This app means I can skip the que and hit the road after filling up. Top marks BP ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Having used the app several times now I cannot find fault with it. A very easy app to use that allows me to pay my fuel bill without entering the sales building if Iâ€™m in a hurry. Not having to lock up my car and remove any valuables is a bonus too even better if I have my grandson with me I donâ€™t have the hassle of unbuckling him, the inevitable refusal of sweets at the checkout and the refusal of getting back into his car seat to deal with. So all in all a big thumbs up from this nanna ðŸ‘
"Easy to use app, great that the Nectar Card is also included in the app.
Also great for Parents, donâ€™t have to leave your car! Simple and easy to use, thanks for the app BP!"
This now has a Â£100 pre authorisation fee that stays on your account for 4 to 5 days, developer response is that it can take up to 10 days for the pre authorisation fee to come off your account
"Iâ€™ve been using this app for maybe 3 months at first it was fine then for the last 4 times my card has been declined with money available.
Iâ€™ve stopped using this app.
but decided after you had an update it would be fine but itâ€™s the same old rubbish so after having it declined again Iâ€™m not going to be using this again"
I found at least 2 stations that doesnâ€™t accept the app payment .
Fantastic app, quick and easy to use...
"Iâ€™ve only been able to use this app twice. I get an error message every time now. Good idea if the app was more reliable. Itâ€™s embarrassing waiting at the pump to then have to give up. 

I now get the message â€˜no available pumpsâ€™ - even though Iâ€™m the only car on their forecourt"
I love BPMe and have been using it ever since it started! I use it for both my personal bank card and my fuel card. Both work fine with the app and itâ€™s always a smooth transaction. I love that you can add your nectar card to the app too so I donâ€™t forget to collect my points as well as saving time queuing!
Running iOS / iPhone X, the app simply doesnâ€™t work. On trying to login, the app hangs. Uninstalled, reinstalled. Same problem.
App wonâ€™t load. Circling all the time
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 12, latest BP me app installed...just hangs after pressing login - I'm using my home fibre WiFi...
"This app looks great, but it will not let me log in. It just sits on the first screen with a circle whirling around and never changes. Not particularly confidence building and doesnâ€™t really make me want want to trust it with bank details... not that I can, of course, because it will not log in!

Update: BP replied to my review to tell me there was an updated version which should have fixed this. However they didnâ€™t notice that my review was written more recently than their latest update was released, so unsurprisingly the app is still useless and wonâ€™t log in. At least Iâ€™ve never been able to get used to using it, but itâ€™s frustrating when a big company like BP is so useless! My advice: don't bother."
"Do I have time for anything these days ? - No, so any time I can save I do and the BpMe app is a really fast way to fill up on fuel.
As soon as I open the app I am ready to go, I like how I can choose an amount to fill but most importantly I dont get hassled by my youngest to buy sweets when I pay for my fuel - so thatâ€™s time saving and money saving.....BONUS!!"
Downloaded the app after seeing it advertised at my local petrol station however after the initial register when I click log in it just continuously loads and never actually allows sign in to happen. Really like the idea of the app so hopefully it will be fixed.
"The spinning wheel of death is all I see. If the app is going to work then it needs to work when needed. 
The app endlessly thinks and does nothing or crashes. I tried to make it work at the petrol station but it couldnâ€™t find the petrol station/ my location even though I tried to set everything up before I sat at the pump holding everyone up. 
I had to give up on the app; paying by credit card is still easier"
Never in the history of apps will you endure a longer sign up process
"I am not recommended  this apps. i started  to use this app since last week, I filled fule last week three times each Â£10. But they holding Â£300 on my account each time they holding Â£100 from my Account.
Transactions all clear on my account but still they holding Â£300.
All my others DD are returned, when I called my bank they said BP still holding money.

Because of this app, I am not going to BP any more."
Works perfect! Even emails you your receipt! and ability to use fuel card too - no need to queue anymore! Fill & go....  just brilliant!
Doesnâ€™t work technical error when selecting pump
I love this App.  It makes life so simple on a busy day when you just need to get & go fuel its great!
I downloaded the BPme app on my old iPhone and it worked flawlessly.  I recently updated to a new iPhone XS running iOS 12 and now the app refuses to load up.  I get to the title screen and when I hit log in the circle in the middle of the screen just rotates. It does not jump to password screen.  Very frustrating.
"I can login to nectar.com but the app doesnâ€™t accepted the card number and password, why is this.
I tried to leave feedback via the app but it wouldnâ€™t send it!"
Fingerprint and auto fill not working on my 5s iPhone with this app. Forced to re-enter name and password every time!
Doesnâ€™t work with iOS 12. Press login and it just keeps on same screen then stops
App login has stopped working!!!
Since the ios12 update I can no longer log in.  Have deleted and reinstalled but still no luck, very poor roll out.
This app makes it quick and easy to pay for petrol without having to wait in the queue to pay. It also immediately sends you a vat receipt to your registered email for your accounts â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸
Downloaded app, registered, activated registration, then got the spinning wheel of doom every time I tried to â€œlog inâ€ - totally useless.
Now seems broken on my iPhone XS. Canâ€™t log in at all.
Despite numerous emails to BPme the two stations at Marus bridge and whelley do not work but still remain on the map S being available. The one at whelley has never ever been available according to the manager if the filling station.
"Nice idea but when it used to work it would take forever to get to the point where you could select a pump, and now just doesnâ€™t work at all.

And yes, I have the latest version - and it doesnâ€™t work."
Used this app several times when first released without any problems since then every time I try it my bank declines the payment, for what reason I donâ€™t know. I can only assume itâ€™s something thatâ€™s changed on BPâ€™s end. Disappointing as itâ€™s really useful to avoid queues of people doing their weekly shop when I just have Â£20 of fuel to pay for.
2 card declined.
Got an email from Visa saying Â£5 cash back if Iâ€™d use BP Me. Iâ€™d been wanting to try it so thought this is a good time as I only ever use BP fuel as will not use supermarket fuel. Downloaded app, put first name and surname in hit next, read privacy policy and the other policy, ticked both boxes agreeing to T&Câ€™s, entered email address, Tried to move to next and it says thereâ€™s a problem! Gave up and looked at the Shell app which has much better reviews so may try that!
I downloaded the app on my Iphone, registred new account, confirmed via email than I tap to open the app and I am waiting for next 10 minutes but it doesnâ€™t open. I closed the app and started again, the result was the same. I restart my phone, try to open the app - no result. I spent 1 hour trying to open the app. I am very disspapointed.
Select log in - Sticks on spinning circle. Rubbish
"Like others I have gone through all the procedures of selecting pump and payment limit, then started filling up, only to find that there was a problem when I got back into the car and so have to then go into the shop queue up and pay having wasted my time sitting in the car setting up the app in the first place.
I have now virtually given up trying this app.
I do not have this problem with the Shell App which works very well."
Wonâ€™t even let me log in, just keeps doing a spinning green circle, been sat in the car 15 mins trying to log in, would of been quicker to go in and pay!!!!
If you do have a Santander card donâ€™t bother with this app as it apparently does not support this bank
Created account and logged in just fine. Couldnâ€™t connect to the bank though when trying to add a card. Also couldnâ€™t give feedback! Seems the developers havenâ€™t got this quite right.
Doesnâ€™t even load
Canâ€™t actually review the app as it wouldnâ€™t load. Tried 3 times. Now deleted. Try again BP ðŸ˜­
It was working fine until I updated my phone to iOS 12. Now all I get is a screen which is static. Iâ€™ve tried deleting and reinstalling it but no joy. Please sort it out
I would like to have used this app however after registering I canâ€™t actually get to the login screen, it continually loads and never the page doesnâ€™t open. Wouldnâ€™t trust this to workat the pump either
Itâ€™s good but it sometimes doesnâ€™t work sometimes it says all the pumps are taken when there clearly not and also it always goes 50p less than what I selected
"[ios 12 iPhone 8] Installing the app was fine. Registering was also fine. But once a PIN had been set itâ€™s then impossible to use: tapping â€œlog inâ€ results in the spinning â€˜busyâ€™ animation for several minutes before being told â€œNetwork error: it appears youâ€™re not connected to the internetâ€. No BP, youâ€™re wrong, my internet connection is fine itâ€™s your app which is at fault here.
I force-quit the app in a bid to retry, but alas, same thing happened again.
For the record, Iâ€™ve left it over night and tried again this morning, result: still doesnâ€™t work.
Come on BP sort it out."
Canâ€™t log in at all
"I downloaded the app then spent 20minutes attempting to link a card. Tried 3 but all received error messages. I had full 4G but tried again with Wi-fi and still didnâ€™t work.
I then attempted to leave feedback via the app and surprise-surprise it doesnâ€™t accept that either! If it did Iâ€™m sure the rating would be even lower."
Iâ€™m an avid collector of nectar points so I was swayed by the offer of 500 points to sign up to BPme. However, I canâ€™t register any of my cards. 2 credit cards and 2 debit cards could not be added.
"Iâ€™ve really tried to get on with the app, but itâ€™s just not well thought out and gets blocked by Natwest every single time. Natwest have said they just need to be contacted by the BPme team and theyâ€™ll work with them to resolve, BPme just say itâ€™s the banks and canâ€™t do anything. Awful. 

Incredibly slow when starting up and going through the process of getting ready to use the pump. 

With every update, it logs you out. Not hard to get right and only made slightly less frustrating with the latest iOS 12 integration with password keepers. 

Focus on the customer experience and invest or withdraw the app."
Awful, donâ€™t brother
Wow since this latest update the frustratingly slow startup seems have been fixed completely. Itâ€™s great now!
Tried it three times at different stations , which are few meeting the criteria near me. First time although app showed was BPme enabled it wasnâ€™t and clerk had never heard of it. Second and third times app recognised station and asked for pump number but both times it said a technical error had occurred, please try again. Not on your nelly. Only downloaded to get nationwide b soc Â£5 cash back as BP is expensive
"Your iPhone has been locked whilst youâ€™ve been driving. Youâ€™re now at the BP garage. Next to the pump. Youâ€™ve switched off your engine. Youâ€™ve unlocked your phone with Face ID. You open the BP app...and wait....for a pretty animated screen to animate for a few seconds and another Face ID Authenticator to acknowledge you again. Why? Why? Why? 

Youâ€™re now winding up the guy behind you queuing to use the pump. Heâ€™s seen you pull up to the pump and just sit in your car looking at your phone!  

For goodness sake, loose the FaceID - Iâ€™ve already saved my card details in your app. And loose the animated screen. I know itâ€™s a BP app. Iâ€™m at a BP garage. There are BP logos all over the garage, on the entrance sign, on the pump, on the front of the store and even in the App icon I just pressed to launch the flipping app. 

Save valuable time at the pump and sort it out."
Login much quicker since the last update.
Title says it all. This app wonâ€™t work with my bank card, so it (the app) is pretty much useless.
"The worst app I've ever had in a phone. How do I use this if I can't even add a payment method?? Gives out error everytime I try to add my card the past 2 days!!!!!

and NO!, we DON'T NEED animations on a payment app! we just want to pay!!!!"
App wouldnâ€™t accept my company card payment and then when I went in to pay, the til wouldnâ€™t accept the card payment either. So now I have to return to pay another time. Waste of time. Deleted.
Iâ€™ve updated the app but canâ€™t get past the spinning wheel and app wonâ€™t open for me.
"At first I couldnâ€™t log in, it just kept loading or I couldnâ€™t add a card. 

Since the update itâ€™s working fine. ðŸ‘ðŸ¼"
"Iâ€™ve used the app once to pay for fuel and I found it very quick and easy.

My one complaint as a business user would be the size of the receipt that is emailed. Once printed it took up 3 sheets of A4 paper, I would hope this could be condensed down to fit on one page."
After using this app for the last 4 months Iâ€™m still wondering why A company like BP canâ€™t fix this app. What a waste of time at the pump. Takes ages to open and then itâ€™s unable to recognise your pin and doesnâ€™t even allow the option for finger recognition. Worst app Iâ€™ve used even beginners are better.
App works all the time. It will make sure you have Â£100 pound in bank before authorised. Happy with the app!!!
BPme is a great time saving idea. No more queuing to pay for fuel, just fill and go.
I have used the ap once successfully, twice after that it didnâ€™t work, then the third time it seemed to be working but after I had put my petrol in a message came up on the screen to say something had gone wrong and that I had to go inside to pay. I did, then checked my internet banking and the payment had been taken twice! I rang BP who told me it was only pre- authorised and would go back in within 2 days, despite me telling them it was showing as a cleared transaction on my account. I then emailed them because they are only open 9-5 and I attached a screen shot of my bank account. They told me they could see the money going back into my account but I explained that was someone else putting money in my account- nothing to do with the BP transaction. The name on my statement wasnâ€™t even similar it just happened to be the same amount!! Now I canâ€™t get through, and no reply to my email & I still havenâ€™t received my money back. I went into the garage and they canâ€™t help me either! Will never use the ap again.
"Unfortunately for me today that I couldnâ€™t use the app after I driven over 7 miles to the nearest BP station. 

The app stated that the station I went to wasnâ€™t available for the app to use. Then it said please pay inside the store. 

So I drove off in anger."
I would estimate a 50% success rate when using this app. When it doesnâ€™t work, you end up spending more time sorting it out and trying to work out if youâ€™ve been charged twice than just walking inside and paying.
Love this app. It makes getting fuel painless. No queuing, fill up and go. People can do all the shopping they like and Iâ€™m no longer stuck in a long queue behind them
BP me is so quick and easy to use! Amazing during morning rush when you donâ€™t want to stand in a massive queue! Would highly recommend!
This is about the 5th time I have tried to use this. This time in was instrumental in getting my credit card blocked, then when I unblocked it I got a message saying something was wrong so I had to pay at the kiosk. It took longer than the normal way. This has only ever worked once. Canâ€™t believe they promote it so much and itâ€™s one of worst app I have ever used.
"This app has such promise and potential. When it first launched it took ages to sync and log in- but it did eventually work. I go to the same BP garage near me and in recent months it has refused to work at all. I sit at the pumps at an empty forecourt to be told no pumps are available right now. I refresh: I quit. I restart. All to no avail. Utterly repeatable.
The staff at the garage shrug their shoulders dismissively.
If the app developers can sort out why this is and produce an app that a stable and consistently reliable I might consider reinstalling but for the moment it is deleted."
Fantastic, save a lot time avoid any queue!!!!!!
Used this app it said Iâ€™ll get 500 bonus point on first use not received them plus I put in the app to fill up with Â£20 the pump stoped at Â£19 and was still changed Â£20 wonâ€™t use again
Useless really. It either doesnâ€™t locate the station that I have parked at or if it does, no pump numbers are available. Deleted it. Shame
I went to a BP in Guildford I was almost on empty. I got there and the shutters was down at the shop but it had huge posters showing that you can pay with the pay me app. So I pulled over downloaded the app and put in my details. When I went to fill up i selected to fill up full tank, it said itâ€™ll hold Â£100. The app then said something like oops something went wrong, try again or cancel. Now Iâ€™m desperate for fuel so I clicked try again it still didnâ€™t work so I went to shell down the road. Now a day later I looked at my bank statement it shows Â£200 is on hold from that BP petrol station. Iâ€™ve lost all trust in this app. I hope I get my money back.
"Since the log-in issue has been fixed, this is working brilliantly!
I use it for pretty much all of my fuelling now as itâ€™s so easy. Itâ€™s really fast too despite only two bars of network on my local station. I only select the amount I actually expect to fill up for so it doesnâ€™t reserve a large sum of money on my account. Fair enough it stops about a pound short sometimes but I much rather it does that than overshoot my budget if the pump isnâ€™t accurate enough. I love that I can easily see how much I spent week on week.
Best thing about it is that I never have to step away from my car, as I usually have a clingy or sleeping baby on the back seat!"
Seems like they took everything shell got wrong and made it work. Well done .
Love this app, especially when I have the baby in the car! No need to have the hassle of waking a sleeping baby - well done BP
"â€œUnknown errorâ€ 
â€œAccount suspendedâ€ during first login itself, call customer services which is pathetic 
Unable to add card details..
Waste of time app."
"Too the time and trouble to set up nectar card and credit card on the app. 
First time I tried to use it was painful. Possibly due to poor signal but it didnâ€™t think I was at a BP service station and when it finally accepted that I was it told me to pay in store as this particular service station wasnâ€™t set up for it despite it actually directing me to this station when I tried to find the nearest one.
Iâ€™ll give it another go one day but I anticipate deleting this app. It was probably a cell signal issue but the bottom line is that it wouldnâ€™t work."
Not much use for company car drivers. Happy to re review when Allstar is added as a payment option but for now the app is of no use.
"Surprisingly easy to use and actually does what it says. Almost every BP has this available unlike Shell who only give it to their refurbished locations! 

Will be using BP from now on ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
I donâ€™t know how well the app works as every time I have gone to a bp garage which accepts mobile payments it has been unavailable.
"Too often I've opened the app and tried to unlock a pump only to be greeted by an error... something went wrong try again or unable to unlock pump, please try again...

The app is also slow to log in and load. The final nail in its coffin was requiring Mastercard secure code, which means my preferred bank card doesn't work now. With no Apple Pay support I've given up on this."
Pretty hopeless. It didnâ€™t work for several days the first time I installed. When I was able to use, every time I logged out I was unable to log back in, getting an error message. It was at least 24 hours before I could successfully log back in. It has now failed to work at all with a constant error message whenever I try to log in. I have tried changing password, even using another email address, but still the same problem.
I would prefer it if this app had the payment options of PayPal and Apple Pay enabled in the apps payment services rather than debit or credit card.
I have tried to add my card to my BPme wallet but for some reason it tells me card not registered, cannot be added to your BPme Wallet. I have tried 3 of my cards and all say same thing. Do I need to call my bank and ask them or is it an issue with the app? Please let me know. If it helps one of the card is a Barclays Visa Debit and another Metro MasterCard Debit.
Tried in two different stations and this app never worked. It said the pump is unlocked but it never start to fill when I press the nozzle.
Always have service issues, or it asks me to go in and pay. Shell and Esso make 200% better versions
Working really well so far and super-easy to use, the one thing that would make this app perfect for me is having live prices available for each station (because you vary them even within the same town..).
"My PayPal has been raped since using this app.
Clearly a problem with the connection in the garage itself."
"Do not use the â€˜full tankâ€™ option. Filled up on Monday Â£100 reserved in account immediately. 
Fuel transaction debited on Thursday. Balance still reserved on Friday. Not good enough in this day and age and will not use again."
Handy to have if you donâ€™t have card. When you select how much you want to spend on fuel it deducts 50p per use.
Location finder cannot find my location
Called bp twice to try and get it to work and it still doesnâ€™t. Donâ€™t waste your time
Every time I try to enter my 4 digit pin, it just keeps telling me the email address is already registered and I canâ€™t complete the process,  very frustrating!
Took ages to load. Let me select the petrol station but would not let me select a pump. Tried a few times :(
Few initial glitches where it sometimes didnâ€™t work for no good reason but seems to be resolved. So quick and easy and feel smug when drive off looking at the enormous queue that always takes forever in the shop.
I thought this was a great idea when it was first advertised as it would avoid those long queues waiting to pay. However, whenever I fill up, I want to be able to fully fill the tank & I have no idea in advance how much that will cost. If BP has your card registered, why canâ€™t you just fill up and then they deduct that amount. Having to choose in advance how much you want to spend is extremely frustrating as I have no idea how much that will be. Hence I have downloaded the app and donâ€™t use it. Come on BP, please be more flexible as to me your app is a waste of time
Found the station, couldn't find the pumps before or after filing. No one at forecourt knows how it works either. cue paperwork and police declarations and a drive out again afterward with an actual card to pay for the fuel. Won't use again and will tell everyone I know to stay away
"The first 2 times I used the app it was great ,after that every time Iv tried to use it it wonâ€™t connect or comes up error please again . 
Far from saving time Iâ€™m wasting time trying to get it to work ,
Spoke to one of the assistants in the shop to be told they were in an internet black spot and they couldnâ€™t even get it in the shop . Making the app pretty much useless . 
As I often have the dogs in the car and donâ€™t like leaving them I will carry on using the petrol station where you can pay at the pump ."
I live within a stoneâ€™s throw from 3 BP stations - none of which are BP me enabled - the whole point of installing this app is lost
"It doesnâ€™t allow Amex . 
Trying to ad my card . When I put 4 digits CVV, It doesnâ€™t allow me to ad my card . 

But I received a offer from Amex that if I use this card Iâ€™ll be rewarded.
Very funny"
Canâ€™t add AMEX card, the app canâ€™t recognise the 4 numbers CVV.
"Tried a million times adding my Amex card (UK), 
App keep reverting back error messages â€œcard not registeredâ€ 
Also if scanned the app will demand a 3 digit CVV from an Amex card, when itâ€™s actually 4 digits for Amex. Stupid! 

Do not recommend, not usable for Amex Card holders."
So. Went to my local BP went  through process of fueling my car (after getting confirmation that Â£100 would be held) only for the security guard to tell me the app wasnâ€™t working and Iâ€™d have to go in and pay at the kiosk.   Fortunately I had my card with me. I asked the attendant what would have happened had I not had my card and was told I would be reported for having no means of payment!!!! Not my fault.   These glitches need sorting or abandon the app!
"This should be great.....sleeping baby in the car, no need to worry I can pay from my seat. Nope.

So upon downloading the app I tried the tutorial.....it wouldnâ€™t load. I tried the faqâ€™s.....wouldnâ€™t load either. I go to a station and I fill up expecting to pay for my fuel only to discover I have to book the pump in advance like in some third world country.

I try again thinking this time Iâ€™ll get it to work.....book my slot and itâ€™ll work seamlessly. Doesnâ€™t even recognise Iâ€™m at a station. Lots of closing and refreshing and still nothing. Lots of beeping from the queue behind me so I drive off. Waste of time.....Iâ€™ll just continue to use the pay at pump at Tesco instead."
"Will only accept a three number CVV so canâ€™t input an Amex card for payment. It simply wonâ€™t click through to the next page.
Probably therefore not worth using for me."
"BP are heavily pushing this app this month and offering cash back with American Express (Â£10 cash back on Â£30 purchases made via the app) but the BP station I went to claimed they did not accept app based payments.

Firstly the station itself - BP branded - showed up in the app. When I arrived the app showed the location I was at accurately, allowed me to select the pump I was at and it claimed the pump was unlocked for filling and to leave the phone in my car. I filled up with Â£45 but when getting back in the car the app claimed an error had occurred and I needed to pay in the shop. The attendant then said the location didn't accept app payments, so if course I had to pay by card and missed out on the promised cash back. 

If a station is BP branded, shows up in the app and even claimed the pump was unlocked, how am I as a customer supposed to know that this is not true? I feel like this app needs a lot more testing and frankly it is highly unfair to be luring people to use it with cash back offers that are impossible to claim on!"
All good and saves the ques going in store.
I used the app in conjunction with an American Express offer. The offer said that if you pay 30 pounds of fuel you would get back 10. When it arrived to 29.50 it suddenly stopped not allowing me to get the promotion. Such a joke!!!
"Iâ€™ve been trying register my Amex card, the App wonâ€™t take the 4 digit CID code.

It thinks I have put in one digit too many, as per Visa/MasterCard which only have 3 digit CVV code.

As a result this App is no use to me."
Won't add AMEX card as it won't accept 4 digit CVV. Useless
Canâ€™t register an Amex card to the app.
App wonâ€™t allow the 4 digit CVV Amex number to be added - only accepts 3 digits. #fail
The app will not upload my AMEX credit card and I canâ€™t find any where to get app support on this. Just wasted 30mins internet searching for help to no avail. Nice idea if it worked but in its current state, itâ€™s a waste of time.
I downloaded this due to an offer sent through by Amex (only redeemable if you pay through the app connected to your card)... though when trying to add details it doesnâ€™t recognise a 4 digit CVV so itâ€™s impossible to redeem.
"Question after question to register. A convoluted process to register your Nectar card, including EIGHT CAPTCHAs, a giant cookie warning from Nectar â€” and it STILL hasnâ€™t attached the card. Why not just ask me to TYPE IN THE NUMBER ON THE FRONT OF THE CARD â€” or are BP planning to make using a Nectar card at the checkout this awkward too?

On to adding payment details: the App Store listing claims Apple Pay support, but there is no option â€” just entering a card manually or adding a fuel card. Why say it supports Apple Pay and then hide it?

I have no idea how much more of a pain this is going to be to actually USE. I suspect Iâ€™ll use it once to get the Amex cashback and then delete it â€” or just go to a garage that has pay at pump, which BP donâ€™t seem to want to bother with anywhere around here!

Oh, and you canâ€™t register an Amex card anyway, as it only accepts 3 digit CVVs and Amex uses 4. Did ANYBODY even BOTHER to test this before releasing it?"
Wonâ€™t allow for Amex verification code to be loaded - expects 3 digits and the button gets greyed out if you put in 4 digits. Plus if you try and link your nectar account - wonâ€™t recognise either the card number or password - even after validating them by logging in via the website. Locked out of Nectar now - very poor app - do not bother to download.
Whoever wrote this app deserves to be fired. Itâ€™s taken me an hour to go through what should be a 30 second on boarding process. Worst experience ever. Only forcing myself to go through it for the Â£10 Amex promotion. Will never use it beyond that. Embarrassing.
Tried four times to link an Amex Card, now giving up. Asks for Site Key verification but doesnâ€™t give any method of confirming the code.
"I downloaded this because AMEX have an offer on if you use it to pay using your AMEX. But the app wonâ€™t let me register my AMEX because it wonâ€™t take the four digit CVV. 

Silly mistake, and completely pointless. Will be deleting - Iâ€™d rather do without the free fuel than deal with the faff!"
Downloaded it weeks ago still stuck on log in screen every time I try it goes back to log in or register page... useless
"Seems like great idea but lots of trouble getting it set up. Scanned in Amex card based on their Â£10 off offer. Declined to accept 4 digit cvv. When I keyed in the account number rather then using their scan, it worked fine so I thought. Fully accepted but expiry date of card on app showed incorrect date. Deleted card and re-input making absolutely sure expiry correct. Again security checks accepted - but app still shows wrong expiry!

Then put in Nectar, accepted. Closed app and reopened - Nectar no longer linked!

Checked other feedback and see some garages decline after filled up as not using app despite being on app as accepting! So it seems you need to go in first, join the queue, find if accepted, then fill up if you want to collect the Â£10 Amex reward.

Doesnâ€™t anyone check these apps before launching? I will not be wasting any more time, shame as idea good."
What's wrong with this app, BPme app charged 4 times from my Amex card at 6.38pm Nov 30 waterbeach a10 petrol station 5 kiosk but 5 minute waiting no petrol came & I went off, now pending transaction showing 4 times X 31Â£ : 124 Â£ you should take from my card without a single milli of petrol in my car? Pls check the CCTV and sort out appropriately!
I tried to use this payment system but the pump would not unlock, app in constant loop. Message asked me to try again and as a result my credit card was pre authorised 4 times x Â£100. NP need to get the technology right before launching and promoting via Amex. I doubt I will use BP again
No support for Apple Pay so you have to faff in advance to setup your card. Then no clear instructions in the app on how to use - even just a simple 1,2,3 steps when you select the station would help. Finally, it didnâ€™t work due to â€œtechnical difficultiesâ€ and told me to pay in shop.
The app works well, but the app is slow to boot up.
Rubbish. BP has managed to create an app based process that takes more time to pay than doing it old school. App: Open app to find station - select pump - pre-authorise before you refuel - this takes time (old school you donâ€™t need any of that and especially you donâ€™t need card pre-authorisation). So donâ€™t bother with using it as itâ€™s quicker to just show up, refuel and pay at the till.
Amex is running a promotion, which convinced me to try the bpme app but to my surprise, the app won't accept a 4-digit security number...it makes no sense!
Canâ€™t add nectar card. Doesn't recognised password.
"Never got it to work.

Would only let me enter an Indian mobile number."
American Express sent me an email promoting BPme with Â£10 of a Â£30 spend or more.  I installed the app and set my AMEX card as the default method of payment. I filled up spending Â£80.50 at Euro Frontier Park Blackburn. However the app couldnâ€™t find my location to enable me to pay at the pump therefore I couldnâ€™t benefit from the Â£10 off.  I complained to the counter staff who said there had been several other instances of this fault.
"I last tried this app back in the spring, and it didnâ€™t work then. More than half a year later, and lured in by the Amex Â£10 rebate, I thought it might be safe to try again - surely the teething problem would be sorted out by now?

No such luck. This time I got as far as trying to select the pump number, before â€œSorry, weâ€™re having some technical issues. Please start again or fill up and pay for your fuel in the shop.â€

So I exited the app, and tried again. Same thing.

Thatâ€™s two out two tries that Iâ€™ve wasted time on the forecourt, looking like an idiot.

The Shell app, on the other hand, has a 100% success rate."
"The app is full of errors. Having chosen my pump and filled up my car the app then came up with an error message saying pay in the shop

I spoke to the guy at the shop and he told me that lots of people have issues with the app

My bank account has Â£300 of pending charges which I hope disappear

Only reason I got the app was due to an Amex deal where you get Â£10 back for using the app. Seems to me a scam to get people filling up at BP garage and then not give the Â£10 back as the app fails

I donâ€™t recommend it. Easier to just go into shop and pay. Youâ€™ll end up having to do it anyway with the app issues"
"Open the app and registered etc scanned card put other details in (correctly) didnâ€™t want to finish tried an other card still no good so bl useless!
Day 2 
Tried again to add payment card on iPhone 8 not letting me finish although correct details are put in also tried on iPad no good.
Also tried to contact BP on an enquires line wonâ€™t let me put any writing in the message box 
Very frustrating. I give in obviously donâ€™t want my custom!

1 week later called in BP Station  assistant says it not set up properly ...... (doesnâ€™t work here love)"
Shame, I canâ€™t try this App because it doesnâ€™t seem happy with a 4 digit CVV/CID for my American Express Card â˜¹ï¸
Trying to put Â£30 in tank app stopped at 29Â£ and quicker to pay in the store!!
Use this all the time where possible now. E-Mail VAT receipt which is great for work expenses and minimal time waiting around at the pump. However if you get poor mobile coverage around your local station then youâ€™ll end up disappointed.
Doesnâ€™t work at Seamer Road Service Station in Scarborough. It gets to the pump unlocked stage and then gives an error message and says to pay in store.
Pre approve Â£30 but the pump only lets you fuel up to Â£28. Donâ€™t have time for crap apps that donâ€™t deliver what they promised
Worked first few times and whilst you donâ€™t actually get the amount you asked for (always Â£1 below) the main issue is it has stopped working. Get to local station and over last three times says no pumps available even though plainly there are. Reported it each time to local station but no change.
Tried to use it today at a BP station in Farnham. It found the station fine and I entered the pump number but got an error message telling me to try again or pay in kiosk. I did the latter which completely defeats the objective! The lady in the kiosk said I wasnâ€™t the first one today to have problems. Going to delete it.
"Used happily with 5* rating until latest update. Error message saying Technical Issues when selecting pump number. 

Had to pay in the shop. Cashier said app not worked for 2/3 weeks.  No point of app if it will not work. Good job I had my credit card! Needs sorting ASAP"
Recently changed my handset so needed to reinstall the app. But forgot my old password..may be more than 20 times i have followed forgotten password link and put my email through but never received with a response or link. When i tried to do it through text it just allows me to input mobile number for only twi countries India and Netherlands. These are two very basic area where developers need to improve
The whole reason I used BPme was due to the Amex promotion. It said it would stop 50p short but instead it stopped around Â£1.50 short causing me not to be eligible for the promotion.
It has â€˜convenientlyâ€™ stopped working at the same time AMEX offer a Â£10 cash back offer for using the app. Twice Iâ€™ve tried at different stations since the offer has been active, worked fine before...
Tried today for first time and keep showing error â€œsomething is wrong, please try againâ€.
Service is good but getting charge 50p extra in each transaction
DO NOT USE THIS APP. App screwed around with my location and privacy settings. I only noticed because I look out for these things.  Even after uninstalling the app, my location and privacy settings stayed messed up. Having wasted 3 hours trying to sort it i now need to Restore Factory Settings on my phone. DO NOT USE THIS APP.
Tried the app twice now, despite selecting â€˜fill the tankâ€™ or a selected amount of money the pump has only allowed me to put in Â£1.00 worth of fuel. I then have to replace the pump and then fill the car and pay inside - complete waste of time.
Tried to set this app up and use the first time user offer via Amex Uk. The app wonâ€™t accept an Amex card either by scan or manual entry. Pointless!
Just says technical error try again later. Never had any problems with the similar Shell App but BP obviously canâ€™t make a working app.
I tried to use the app at the nearest BP to me but found that despite the pumps saying I could use it the shop said its not working there! Then onto another BP station where my scanned card would not work! Had to put in card details manually! Then it would not accept payment at the pump as I had filled petrol first! Nowhere did it mention that I should wait first! Consequently I will not get on of the offers I was hoping to get!
"Doing everything as I should and just always an error so telling me to just pay in store. One station Iâ€™m inside the forecourt but the GPS location for the station seems itâ€™s metres or so away so it wonâ€™t recognise that Iâ€™m next to a pump!
Wouldnâ€™t have mattered as itâ€™s not going to work anyway. I am pretty annoyed because I have got a really good American express deal if I use the BP meet up before the end of the month hence why I downloaded it. What a useless measure that was"
Tried 3 different petrol pumps supposedly accepting BPme. None worked. Waste of time.
Great if you want the petrol attendant shouting at you over the forecourt ! Off to Esso
"I have been to two local petrol stations that are advertised to accept the app. On both occasions the app works and reserves money on my card, only for the pump not to unlock and to be told by the staff they don't accept the app and I have to pay by card. I have emailed customer service each time and had no reply after the quoted 3 working day response time. 

Only wanted to try it because of the AMEX promotion, won't bother now and will get my petrol cheaper elsewhere and with less hassle."
"Went to bp to use the app... 
wouldnâ€™t let me use the pump... 
guy came out and said the app wont work because youâ€™re not allowed phones in fuel stations... 
how the hell are you meant to use the app to pay, WHEN YOUâ€™RE NOT ALLOWED PHONES?!?!?
Absolutely stupid."
Not a lot of good when it doesnâ€™t work when youâ€™ve filled with fuel but then canâ€™t use the app so loose out on the Â£10 cashback from Amex . That was the only reason I used BP as itâ€™s always dearer ðŸ˜¡
"Canâ€™t connect my cards - Amex BA cashback offer - unidentified error message, so canâ€™t use it really.  Tried three different cards - same result.

The TouchID also doesnâ€™t work and app requires entering PIN every time... why enable TouchID then?."
"Terrible app. 
Very poor design and...would give zero star if I could. My wife had a nightmare trying to use this. 
1st pump didnâ€™t work. 
2nd pump waited for ages after confirming payment but nothing happened so thought it was okay to fill up...app had probably crashed. 
After she fuelled it then said to start fuelling!
We installed the app to utilise the current Amex Â£10 cash back offer. 
Will probably miss out on this now!
Attendant in station confirmed that this happens very frequently. 
Will delete as soon as offer finished unless the Â£10 cash back is honoured. 
Amex should be ashamed that theyâ€™ve associated themselves which such a terrible product."
I have tried to access the app. Put in all my details. Not able to complete the application.
Same problem as many others.  Lured in by the Amex Â£10 offer.  Went back twice, each time a technical error.  Wasted a lot of time.  Fortunately I did not put on any fuel.  This is not ethical use of a promotion as many people have been lured in to an offer that canâ€™t be used in many instances.
Most of the time app not working specially watery lane middle lane Birmingham station never worked.
"Tried 5 times to use this app and each time it failed whilst at the pump!

Who does your QA testing for you!!"
Doesnâ€™t work with my Amex deal. Error at the pumps
Great idea but obviously BPs infrastructure just doesnâ€™t work. Always get â€œsorry weâ€™re having technical problemsâ€ when you try to use the app at a filling station. Maybe they donâ€™t want to pay the Â£10 cash back offer on AMEX! ðŸ¤£
Great when it works when it doesnâ€™t it declines payment then the bank freezes the card until you confirm by text you made the transaction! Only worked 2 out of 7trys
Amex bought me here but the app doesnâ€™t work.
Finding this so handy when paying for my fuel. Useful that it times out automatically.
Just started using this at our new BP garage in Taunton and itâ€™s amazing. So much easier than Pay At Pump even! Excellent idea.
"App easy to use and works well enough.
The only hiccup was that I selected to put Â£35 worth of fuel in, however, the pump then stopped at Â£33.70 (no, the tank was not full)."
Many issues including wrong amount of fuel delivered and the app failing after fuel delivery started resulting in having to pay in the shop anyway. As an Amex user this rather defeats the purpose as there was money back available if one used the app. I reported 2 separate issues over 2 weeks ago to BP customer services team and apart from an email acknowledgment I i have not heard a dickie bird since.
Horrible experience
So easy to use and so much quicker to pay especially during rush hour, fill and go
Only works 50% of the time, the issue with this is it locks up Â£100 on your credit card ( each time you try) for days at a time if you have full tank selected. AMEX canâ€™t help clear it, needs BP to cancel it. Staff in 2 BP garages it hasnâ€™t worked for me at said itâ€™s rubbish and sometimes works but sometimes doesnâ€™t and there is nothing they can do. Staff also told me it wouldnâ€™t take an authorisation on the card but it defo does.
"Was lured in to use the app by the AMEX spend Â£30 to get Â£10.  First two stations I stopped at didnâ€™t support mobile payments.  The third authorised the pump (IPhone 7 4G connection) then failed half way through.   Luckily I checked before driving off.

Had to pay at the till and the attendant advised me they are having nothing but trouble with people using the app.

BP why are you using us as beta testers?  Get it sorted before releasing.  Esso and Shellâ€™s apps work flawlessly.  Iâ€™ve probably spent Â£10 going out my way to find a BP garage that works with the app!!!!"
I was about to activate this app reading reviews helped me no to trust this no app
Wonâ€™t load offers at all so annoying even after recent update
Doesnâ€™t work, save yourself the hassle
Doesnâ€™t work with Santander Credit Cards Iâ€™ve tried several times
Iâ€™ve used the app a few times using a couple of bank cards. Both initially declined the prepayment despite me having plenty of funds available. I then get a message asking whether it was a genuine transaction but by then Iâ€™ve paid the old way! I appreciate this is banks being over protective but whatâ€™s the point of them allowing me to put the card in to the app if I canâ€™t use it? Could the app please contact the bank at the time I add a card and pre authorise payments?
Tried it once and got the the "oops, something went wrong" message. Now there is no apparent way to delete my account and card details.
Doesnâ€™t work. Why release such an inadequate app?!
Log in and it goes back to main screen. Deleted and tried again and does the same thing. Rubbish
"Tried to use the app, had a repeated error message saying there was an error authorising payment and to try again. Eventually paid in the garage but got home to find I had 5 x Â£100 transactions pending on my credit card. 
Not a robust enough development to be taking payment through."
Sat for ten minutes at the petrol station trying to get the app to work. Gave up when I saw the staff looking at me suspiciously.
Was excited, as much as I could be about paying for fuel, to try this app. Waste of time setting this up at a station if there is no Wifi or mobile data. Tried on two separate occasions without success at Lenham SF connect station ( using O2 ).
Iâ€™m thoroughly disappointed with this app. Iâ€™ve tried to use it three times, each time with no luck. The first location didnâ€™t accept the app, the second location wouldnâ€™t allow me to select a pump and the third location allowed me to select a pump but then errored out after Iâ€™d finished fuelling, but not before putting a Â£99 authorisation on my card. This also means Iâ€™ll miss out on the Â£10 cash back offer from Amex. Iâ€™ll be writing to BP in order to complain about their shoddy app and asking for Â£10 to compensate me for the missed Amex cashback.
"Unable to take advantage of the Amex offer as local BP garage system not working correctly at the time of my filling my car with fuel

Very disappointing"
This app is a great idea, but is not yet production ready. On first use all seemed well; station and pump selected, pump authorised and a Â£100 pre-auth to my account. When I get back into my car there is a message saying the app has been interrupted and I should pay at the cash desk. Another Â£50 charged to my card. I know the pre-auth will lapse, but having 150% of the transaction blocked on my card is not good. The forecourt attendant told me he had seen this same problem three times in the same day, one resulting in a motorist driving away without settling up for his fuel. Needs a bit more testing, I think.
Love it!! So easy!!
"Had no response or contact from anyone regarding fraudulent use at a petrol station, one guy tried to actually blame me
Number of calls and emails but despite promises of contact nothing heard 
I would advise everyone to be careful when using the app"
Went to two different stations one didnâ€™t accept all, the other said it did but wouldnâ€™t go through. Took me 2 weeks to get my amex card added and when i tried to use to get my Â£10 cashback offer I couldnâ€™t. Donâ€™t launch a product that isnâ€™t fit for purpose. Put me off the company altogether!!
Tried to use 3 times, various issues. Cashier cancelling BPme orders and you donâ€™t realise cause your phone is in the car, get back in the car and thereâ€™s a â€œwe are sorry!â€ Message
The app is a joke; total waste of time. I drive to three stations claiming to support the app to redeem a Â£10 free fuel offer from Amex.   Advertised on forecourt they use the app and also within the app.  None of them worked.  The fourth station did work but they didn't sell the fuel I needed.   Waste of time and energy.  The shell app works perfectly Iâ€™d recommend  that over this any day.
I had an offer from Amex if I installed and used the app using my Amex cars to pay. After installing the app, adding the payment card and adding my nectar card, it seemed there was not a way of redeeming a voucher for double nectar points that I also had. Nevertheless I visited a (fairly big)BP station only for the app to tell me the station did not support the app and to pay the cashier, despite it showing on the map as a nearby station. All in all a waste of my time and now to be uninstalled.
Disappointed as app did not find station
"got this after an amex cashback offer. first off the app would not take a 4 digit amex code. Then the system failed with no communication to the first garage on first attempt. went out of my way to try the app again at another garage and the system reserved Â£100 of fuel then failed to dispense the diesel. Chap in pay booth waving arms at me as if to
say the whole thing not working for them even though they are on the app! useless will be deleting the app and asking BP to remove me."
"This app seems ill conceived if itâ€™s meant to ease buying fuel! Having used the same service station for a number of years fuelling 3 vehicles a week averaging about 6k GBP per year the app has single handedly lost BP (and the station) the business! Whilst sitting next to the pump the app. was unable to find the station...eventually having been tannoyed by the attendant for stepping outside the car with my phone (not allowed on the forecourt...why? Iâ€™ve yet to have that explained convincingly!!) I get the app to acknowledge my being in proximity to a BP station. I go for the â€˜full tankâ€™ option which I guess is the same as any pay at pump operation which validates my funds availability. It all starts then the bank intervenes questioning the transaction...this effectively halts the process But leaves me unsure of the transaction status...At this point I leave as I canâ€™t be bothered and buy fuel at another (non BP) station with pay at the pump facility.
Analysing the whole thing I fail to see any advantage in this particular app. It seems  fatally flawed exercise!
Looking at the number of people reviewing with the Â£100 long term reservation problem, coupled with BP dropping Nectar (another reason I go to that particular station) I am better off with the other fuelling apps. that donâ€™t lock up my money for an indeterminate time and work by using existing payment systems."
The app does all the things it promises, but on an iPhone X and a 38mbps 4G connection, payment still takes longer than entering the garage and paying by contactless, which almost renders it pointless.
Do not waste your time as it does not work. BP must not care enough about their customers to release an app after theyâ€™re actually ironed out the kinks. Tried it at three places wonâ€™t work at any. Worked once last weekend but cut out Â£1 early. Utterly useless.
Much easier especially if you have children in the car as you donâ€™t have to get them out to go and pay. also good if you are in a hurry and donâ€™t want to stand in a long queue
"I was at Frontier park services station.
The app was unable to locate the station properly.
I tried to select it manually but unsuccessful.
I still have to walk in to pay.
Pointless app."
"Tried to use this on 3 separate occasions over the space of a week in December and kept getting a message....â€sorry, weâ€™re having some technical issuesâ€

Now deleted."
"I used the app twice; first time setting up for Â£30 fuel but the fuel cutting off at Â£29.50 at the pump, then at a different station I set the app up for Â£31 fuel but it cut off at Â£29.47. (The tank did was not full for fuel to stop on either occasions). I have 2 transactions on my card for a single purchase (4 in total for both occasions) and Iâ€™m still waiting to see which will be the final transaction and worst if I will be charged twice!

Also, the cut off meant that I could not redeem a special offer for spending Â£30 on fuel through my Amex. Due to these bad experiences, I myself will not use it again and would not recommend it anyone as it appears misleading and the incentive mysteriously could not be redeemed at conspicuous amounts."
What a load of rubbish, donâ€™t waste your time
A bit random on when works and can spend 2-3 minutes waiting for it to unlock pump sometimes. Having said that when the system is working, it works very well
"Works well but sometimes it can't open the pump and sometimes takes a while to register.

Only a touch quicker than going in to pay but more convenient."
"First time I used it the pump stopped short of the amount I needed to hit I order to qualify for a promotion!

Second I tried to use it .... was at the pump for a good 10minutes trying to log in then it say it could not unlock the pump! - but the payment went through 3 times on my credit card!

I wonâ€™t be using this again."
This app has worked once in the last 2 months, friends also say the same so it canâ€™t be my phone or station that I use. Can you offer any solutions?
"So convenient and easy to use!
Make sure you set up from home before using for the first time. It verifies your card details so takes a while the first time.
Amazing if you got kids, are in a rush or just lazy!"
I set up an account & tried to use the app but it didnâ€™t work, not even once! Rubbish!
"Tried to use this numerous times but only managed to get it to work once!
The fuel station people tell me they keep reporting problems with it but it still doesnâ€™t get fixed.
So far itâ€™s been a waste of time ."
"This app is one of the worst Iâ€™ve used. The entire concept is flawed. I mean I really need to spend more time in my car before putting in petrol because you â€˜canâ€™tâ€™ use your mobile phone on the court. 
Bring back first world system like in Cyprus and Iceland where you simply put your card in to a central payment machine, say how much you want, put in and drive off. 
Always looking for another way to track, trace and market to a big brother society."
"Had been hesitant to use this app which Iâ€™d downloaded a couple of months ago. Registered my payment card on the app whilst in the car wash and decided to give it a go. Really easy to understand and use. Extremely convenient and will much prefer this to queuing in petrol stations.

Will update this if thereâ€™s anything else to add to it - if I donâ€™t update review then you can assume that itâ€™s all 5 â­ï¸ good!"
Itâ€™s a such a convenient app only downside is my offers for my nectar card never load I canâ€™t seem to see them Iâ€™ve deleted and reinstalled the app but it never seems to work can you please get this issue fixed
I really loved this app until it stopped working.  Every time I try to log in it flashes â€˜oops errorâ€™.  Iâ€™ve tried to re load app and re register but still get the same response.  Any help welcomed.
Game changer. Works every time so far without fail and stops me buying crap in the shop! Good on my pocket and my belly!
"Tried to use this app four times each time app starts to work them times out. I had a strong 4g signal in each case. On one occasion app suggested payment was successful. I checked with the pump attendant who explained the app was rubbish and my payment had not registered. So if I had driven off I would have been classed as a drive away my details would have been passed to the Police!
The other issue is that this app could encourage someone to use their phone on a petrol station forecourt which is a complete no go due to the well publicised explosion risk. There are clear instructions on the app but how many people read and head instructions? I checked my linked credit card and it had a total of Â£400 pre authorised for each of my four tries. 
So as far as I am concerned this app is a big mistake by BP why not just use a pay at pump system like every other modern petrol retailer it is much safer and in my experience reliable. By the way I am not a technophobe I love technology when it works. If there was a zero star I would have selected this. The app is very slick looking and clearly a lot of thought has gone into the concept but so far it looks like style over substance. Hope this helps the folk at BP."
Used it on three different occasions, each time it recognised the filling station and I selected the pump number.  Please fill up and leave phone in car it said.  Twice after I had filled and got back in the car it told me there was a problem and need to go into shop to pay.   Removed from my phone,a good idea but wonâ€™t use BP again.
"There is obviously a problem with this app at the moment. Read the numerous 1 star reviews around this time (January 2019). 
I gave this 1 star a few weeks ago, when the average rating was 4.3. Now after numerous other 1 star ratings, the average is...
4.3!
Shouldnâ€™t that have dropped down a bit by now?"
"Great app and so much easier to pay for fuel. 
More BP petrol stations need to have this option"
Handy, quick and easy to use.
Works great and thereâ€™s no need to queue up just to pay for fuel. Enjoying it!!!
I am at the station, next to the pump and the app doesnâ€™t find the station! Why is there No option to manually choose the station, even if itâ€™s just closest to your current location?
App is not stable. When it works it is ok. It has worked 50% of the time for me.
A real hassle to set up. At least it could support Apple Pay to make it a bit easier, but it currently does not.
This app can hardly ever find the petrol station even when you are there!!! Useless!!!!
"Having tried paying three times using this app failed all three. 
Dismal failure."
Excellent option to be utilised
Having used this app once by just entering my pin, the next time I tried to use it, I was asked to log on with a password. As I had forgotten my password I tried to reset, by giving my email address and phone no. Unfortunately, the country code for the phone no. Input defaults to +91 and there was no option to get it changed to +44 for U.K. so I canâ€™t receive any instructions to change my password. So gave up using the app. App sounds a good idea but itâ€™s execution is appalling.
Sometimes it works and itâ€™s ok but more often than not it doesnâ€™t. Keeps asking me to login and when I try it timeouts. Very very frustrating. I have now removed the app and the frustration. BREATH!!
"It debits your account with Â£100 and then sorts out the exact amount days later. 

Complete rip off."
App said fuel up. Drove off. Had to return to pay cash as transaction failed. Complete waste of time.
Fast, efficient- what is not to like
Outstanding performance myself totally happy with this great service and again many thanks to you BPme you great forever.
App for CarPlay needed
"Used the app to pay as I have done many a time. App confirmed all paid, as did my credit card. 

App had a communication failure with the station meaning the station thought I had not paid and drove off! Instead of BP using any one of my contact details which they hold (address, phone number or email) they decided to go straight for the jugular and send the police to my house who proceed to call me a thief in front of my young children.  

1 month later and not a word of an apology from BP. Atrocious."
Efficient reliable app. Great way to be quick at the petrol station
Downloaded app, set up account, went to bp garage, app kept throwing errors so I just paid the old fashioned way which was much quicker, absolutely pointless!!
"Iâ€™ve used this app for a while and itâ€™s actually very good but today I discovered an issue.

I thought Iâ€™d scrolled the wheel to pump 2 but fat fingers still hit 1 so it unlocked pump 1.

Staff useless and couldnâ€™t help as they didnâ€™t have a process for this so I ended up paying for someone elseâ€™s fuel.

There is a cancel button but it doesnâ€™t highlight and no other way to stop.  I tried to cancel within 5 seconds of it saying pump unlocked!!!

Ended up having to agree with other customer that Iâ€™ve paid for his and he should pay for mine.

Disappointing as have really enjoyed this app but beware as you may not have such an accommodating other customer!"
"My local BP station, the app never works so I go to Sainsburyâ€™s.
Other station the app wonâ€™t work, fuelled at 5 BP stations in Staffordshire and Cheshire the app worked once only.
Donâ€™t waist your time at BP they are to expensive and making 1bn profit from YOU."
"Never need a bank card or cash to fill up .
Be lots better when all stations have this facility"
Generally happy with the app in that itâ€™s always worked well for me. However, it would be good if the pump number selection had a more positive feel to it as I very nearly selected the wrong number on my latest visit.
Tried it today. What a pain. After putting all the info in it kept freezing on the page where my credit card required a passcode. I kept putting the passcode in but nothing would happen and no option to move forward. Just the option to cancel!
This is my second review of this app. It now doesnâ€™t work on any of my credit cards. By the time youâ€™ve finished trying to get it to work, you may as well have just gone in and paid normally!!
Have used 2 times so far itâ€™s ok.
"Downloaded app.
Registered.
Tried to add All Star fuel card as payment method.
Realised I couldnâ€™t.
Deleted app."
"Whenever I tried to use this app it didnâ€™t function.
Either get an error message, unable to find a pump or crashing after closing a pump and unable to get fuel as after retrying the payment card gets blocked.
Absolute joke and not worth downloading. Worst payment app I have used so far I am sad to say"
"Tried hard to use this app. Tried twice.
Both time unsuccessful.

First time turned up at the Petrol station, put fuel in the carâ€™s tank, went to cashier and presented the app to pay. I was wrong!
It doesnâ€™t work that way. Had to pay cash to the cashier.

Second time, came the the BP station. Went to the app and chose the pump. Selected full tank. The app tried to lock Â£100 on my card and failed with no reason. Tried a few more time. Got my card blocked by the bank. Called the bank and unblocked the card. Was told to relink the card to the app. Tried that, but the app failed to add my card now.

Deleted and reinstalled the app. Tried again â€“ no luck.

What a terrible app. 25 minutes of my life wasted for nothing.

Avoid!"
If you want to cut up to 5 mins of your time to refuel then this is your answer
"Terrible concept. Freeze Â£100 from your account, get charged how much you fill up as well! Wait 2 weeks for the frozen Â£100 to be available in your account again! 
Why pay once when you can pay double! 
This is not technology moving us forward!

EDIT: Thanks for the developer response. I am well aware of how the app works! That is why Iâ€™m never using it again and telling everyone else not to use it! I also know I can select lower amounts but when my car takes Â£80+ I donâ€™t see the point of putting Â£20 in! Your response hasnâ€™t told me anything new or apologised for the lack of clarity in your description of how much money will be held for how long. Stay away from this if you donâ€™t have limitless funds."
Has trouble finding any BP station, managed to get it to find my local one once and when it does it comes up with an error when you try to select pump. Very disappointing that you would release an app that is useless
Absolutely brilliant. Why waste time and stand in lines of 10 people.
Easy,fast not need to pay inside the shop
Almost every time I choose to buy Â£20 of fuel and get Â£19.50 worth of fuel which I thought is not an issue when Iâ€™ve realised today that even tho the app is saying Iâ€™ve payed Â£19.50 I have actually payed Â£20 according to my bank statement. Where is going 50p every time Iâ€™m buying fuel? Its a small amount but I had to work for every penny Iâ€™ve got. Iâ€™m not going to use app anymore and to be honest Iâ€™ll be filling somewhere else from now on.
"Step 1 Register
Step 2 log in
Step 3 *an account with this email address already exists*
Step 4 repeat step 2 (I must have clicked the wrong button)
Step 5 (double check I am clicking log in) log in
Step 6 *an account with this email address already exists*
Step 7 delete app
Step 8 use Tesco petrol station, working app, cheaper fuel & worthwhile loyalty club"
"As already mentioned by other users. This app has issues with my bank. On two separate occasions my bank thought i was being conned and froze my account. 
Lovely idea but needs more work"
One thing I hate is when you want to just fuel and go but have to wait ages in line while people do their weekly shopping at the station. This app works great just select pump how much you averagely want to spend and fill the car up. Simple as that.
This app since being introduced, I have not been able to link my nectar card, persistently fails due to poor functionality of BP me app, this really needs to be addressed
"After a few start up hiccups the app works so easily and means I donâ€™t have to wait in a long queue of people with shopping and ordering coffees etc. 
It would be even better if one could get a discount on petrol, as in the USA, where apps are paid for using a debit card number thus the Petrol company can pass on the savings of the credit card fee by offering slightly cheaper petrol."
I love this app. Can just fill up and go. So convenient and time saving.
"I use BP to fill my two large vehicles with premium fuel spending approximately Â£5k per annum. I downloaded to App to speed up the refuelling time and to collate all the receipts for fuel in one place.  It worked well for about a month, but for the past 4-5 weeks it has been a total waste of time.

A) it takes forever for the App to launch B) it requests that I log in again 
C) it takes ages for the log in page to open
D) once I enter my details I have to wait again for the App to log me in

I have given feedback on this on maybe three occasions but have had no response from BP.

This evening I relaunched the App before eventually getting to the page to log in.  I entered my details and waited for the App to log in. And waited. And waited.  Eventually I gave up, filled up, went into the shop, picked up some milk, queued, paid (in two transactions - fuel and milk) and returned to the car.  The App was still trying to log me in!!!!

I am now about to download the Shell App.

Iâ€™m my opinion, this app is a total waste of time!!!"
Excellent app makes me moist
I donâ€™t understand what all the fuss is about. I think itâ€™s brilliant. So easy to use and no more queuing at the tills. If it doesnâ€™t work, it has to be your signal.
Because the promotion, 250 nectar point if I pay by BP Me. After I chose the pump number, wait a while, it says you can fill up now. Before I filled up in full, the app say something wrong and asked me to pay inside the shop. I been the same BP twice in 2 weeks to try. But never success!!! So never earn 1 bonus point!!!
"Good idea, poor execution. 
Could not sign in or verify email.. donâ€™t waste your time or memory on device. Waste of energy donâ€™t download."
"I have used this in the past was great worked well now this past 2months almost it wonâ€™t work at all total utter waste of time.

It keeps saying the same thing over and over weâ€™re having technical difficulties please pay in the shop for fuel. Iâ€™ve deleted the app and tried again on a few occasions but still the same going to delete it for good now and use something like Shell as this is garbage!!!!!"
Unfortunately this app sent you an email with the details.No .pdf or something that could be printed (I donâ€™t want to print my hole email inbox )And there is no print at pump..
"Have nearly given up. Tried at 2 BP stations but app wouldnâ€™t recognise the pump. Ended up paying by card.

Will be returning to the supermarket petrol station"
"This app works really well for me, except in the occasional situation where the petrol station doesn't use it - one near me 'doesn't have enough Internet bandwidth', apparently... Why put all the signs on the forecourt if it's not available?
I'm mystified by why this app isn't integrated with Carplay yet - it should perfect fit, to pay for your fuel using the screen in your car target than having to dig your phone out from wherever you've stashed it. This app was announced as an upcoming arrival for Ford's Sync3 system in about Feb 2018, but it doesn't seem to have appeared...
Come on BP, put it in Carplay!!"
9 time out of 10 it doesnâ€™t work.  Useless. Deleted.
Easy to use. However the receipt sent by emails is 2 pages of A4 so if this could be cut down...?
Just as the title says
Was at my local BP. Started the process of picking my pump and the amount it then said my account had been declined. I check my account and it had already taken the money out. Terrible app wonâ€™t be using again.
"Unfortunately the app is faulty a lot so you need to pay with alternative methods. 
Itâ€™s best not to rely on the app as your only means of payment."
Every single time I tried to use this app to fill up my car using the fill tank option it has failed. I get as far as â€œthe pump is unlockedâ€ then an error screen saying something went wrong. Fortunately I spotted this before driving away the first time and kept an eye on the phone every other time. On each occasion I have gone into the shop to pay the cashier has told me not to bother with the app as it doesnâ€™t work!  Now I understand that BP is stopping Nectar points so I probably will be deleting the app and going to the nearby texaco which is cheaper.
"Lured in by an Amex Â£10 offer. App had a random failure mid fill and told me to pay at the attendant. Attendant said they're still testing and was sorry. 

Yeah right. So I'm a beta tester and you trick me with a discount I can't get. Utterly unimpressed. I'm considering getting Amex to pull its offer as it's basically fraud. I was made to give BP money under false pretences. 

I can buy fuel cheaper elsewhere and so all you're offering is convince with an app that doesn't work, so it's not. I would pay more to avoid queuing, but this app can't be trusted to give any benefits. 

I'd avoid it as it's an empty promise.

---

Update: tried three times to fill at BP. Tried different limits on the fill in the app. Every single one failed and the Amex offer won't pay out. So as far as I'm concerned it's all a total con and a waste of time. Uninstalled.

---

Months later app developers respond with a ""contact support and they'll look into it"". Err no. You've already wasted my time on multiple occasions and as a software developer I know how to use a phone app. Your backend wasn't working at my regular BP and it's not my job to fix your problems. Your data log is only going to show things I can't fix anyway.

Don't lure people to test your system on an Amex offer and then expect anything less when it doesn't pay out."
"Works well for me, (iPhone SE iOS 12.1.4) apart from one occasion where it failed and I had to pay at the counter.

Feature Request:
I would rate it even higher if the app could be used to buy a car wash code instead of having to queue in the shop."
When the app works itâ€™s great but there seems to be a bit of miss trust from my bank for this app because it has blocked my card 3 times in a row when Iâ€™ve gone to use it and then I have to contact the bank to unlock my card. So not only does the app not allow you to pay for your fuel it also blocks your card so you canâ€™t use that to pay either.
The pump always stops 50p short of the amount chosen. In a digital world, surely the pump could be configured to fill to the exact value.
"Worst app of 2019 
What a complete junk"
"The app does what it says and payments are easy but take care when using the full tank option.

Your card / account will be pre charged with Â£100 and it can take 48 hours (or longer if a weekend) for the funds to be released back for you to use - longer than other pay at pump services where it is the same day even an hour after the transaction. Could catch some people out expecting money to be in the account

**UPDATE**

Thought Iâ€™d give this another go to see if BP had improved things...and no. The good news is I didnâ€™t have to wait for my money to be returned but that was because it didnâ€™t take any. The app managed to get my bank card blocked for fraudulent activity! Not worth the hassle and recommend everyone doing what we have always done, go inside and interact with human beings and not machines

And why is the Age Rating 4+ when you have to be over 16 to purchase fuel?"
"Time after time, I try and use this app at BP stations and it comes up with technical error or some other nonsense. Itâ€™s got to the point where I avoid BP!
Shell donâ€™t seem to have this problem...."
It just never works, I always end up going in to pay for fuel. Get as far as confirming amount then tries to load and gets stuck on that screen fill it decides itâ€™s had enough and asks you to re-try. Staff never seem to care each time I tell them.
"I fill up twice a week and if Iâ€™m near a BP Iâ€™d try and use this app. After the third time of my bank card being frozen by my bank because of the Â£100 hold BP put on Iâ€™m stopping because itâ€™s caused all kinds of problems. Not realising my cards frozen until paying for something else itâ€™s caused issues with my work expenses, my travel for work and just all round stress. 

Just seen some other reviews saying to select a fuel amount rather than â€œfull tankâ€ but Iâ€™m not sure I want to risk my card being frozen again."
"I got charged Â£90 and Â£70.
Filled up once got charged twice still not resolved. 10am in the morning Dartford."
Great idea and should work really well especially if you have kids in the car. But every time I use it it just declines and blocks my NatWest debit card. Extremely frustrating
Very good service
"Makes filling up a lot quicker. No need to queue up with people doing their weekly food shop!! 
The only downside is I never receive an emailed receipt after each transaction even though Iâ€™ve contacted customer services a few tines about it."
"The app was working fine until the most recent update. It asks to confirm that you have read and understand the new Ts&Cs and privacy policy. Read them, ticked the boxes and it just continues to go back to the page as if you havenâ€™t already done so and will not allow you to continue on to use the app for its sole purpose........purchasing fuel 
Wish I didnâ€™t update it"
"Tried it about 8 times. Doesnâ€™t seem to work about half of the time.
When it works its fine."
Great when it works but has failed 50% of the time for me.
Spent almost half an hour trying to add payment card and then had the app login suspended. What a waste of time.
"App takes too long (so long sometimes I just cancel) to login, errors too often when choosing a pump or location, very unreliable.

What's the point if you end up just paying for fuel at the till as the app works so infrequently."
Continually blocks my bank card as it removes the same amount every single time Â£100. More hassle than saving me time to be honest!
I was told to get this app to start collecting rewards because the nectar points have stopped, only to find out that the new rewards system is not set up yet. Canâ€™t understand why the new system was arranged before the old system was cancelled.
This app is suppose to make your life easier. It did not work well when I used it. Took about 10 minutes acknowledge my request whilst I sat in my car. Then I requested Â£30 of fuel, it gave me less even though there was capacity for more. In the end I had customers queuing up behind me. Also not very transparent. Why wonâ€™t the app give me fuel prices when looking for a pump nearby!! Just another way of a multinational collecting data on its customers!!
Download the app at the weekend. First of all it didnâ€™t find any BP stations near me, including the one 350m from my home. Drove down and tried to use the pay facility. It wouldnâ€™t connect and kept timing out. After the chap behind pressed his horn a few time I apologised and paid the old fashioned way. App deleted now so back to my Tesco card for payments.
Canâ€™t log on say â€˜unknown errorâ€™
This app donâ€™t work. No point in rewards concept when basics donâ€™t work. Time and time again itâ€™s left me at the pump in limbo, stood there waiting for it to release pump but nothing happens. Embarrassing when cars waiting. Even feedback review doesnâ€™t work either. Iâ€™ll stick to the red and yellow garages from now on.
Add support for wallet passbook on iOS
Been using app since first release and in the main works well but only time I use is obviously when in the car where I have Apple Car play - any plans on making compatible so can use through car play?
This was brilliant until you ditched nectar. Esso here I come!
"Trying to load my card. Tried scanning and manually entering but keeps saying â€œcanâ€™t contact your bankâ€. 
... nice try BP but Iâ€™ll just pay by card at the till."
"Tried using it today for the first! 
It didnâ€™t then said the bank has refused my card, then then bank blocked my card grrrrr
Yes really easy not !!!"
"So Iâ€™ve signed up, received an email, clicked on the link to enter a password.... and it takes me back to the â€˜sign upâ€™ page again (which then crashes when you try to sign up again)
Really not impressed."
Downloaded it, tried to set up an account and the whole app froze. Donâ€™t bother.
Absolutely awful app. Now no nectar points. Esso for me from now on!!
"Registering online generates an account fine, but when it then points you to download the payment app too, the app tries to generate another account instead of connecting with the existing email ID. 

Once in the app, the map has no issue seeing your phone and surrounding stations (2 min drive) but the app itself says â€œHmm you donâ€™t seem to be near a stationâ€ whether on wireless or cellular! It repeatedly apologises saying itâ€™ll work next time you login but restarting and rebooting failed to get a different result.

Probably better to use an app that shows petrol price comparisons or all stations rather than to be brand-loyal. Like a lot of apps they want lots of your data but functionality isnâ€™t there yet."
I have a new bp card which I wish to register for points only to use in the shop and when I buy fuel. I do not wish to enter my bank card details to use pay by the app at the pump.  It is not letting me proceed to the rewards section without entering these details and tells me my registration is not complete and try again when I next log in.  Guess what when you log back it still tells you your registration is not complete. What a con having to enter your bank card details before you can collect points for rewards.
Downloaded app after setting up an account. When I try to log in using all my details it just keeps saying â€˜account already registered with this email addressâ€™. So annoying as it just wonâ€™t let me log in... given up!!!
Constantly says update app no update app available when it goes eventually open takes forever to load
Registered yesterday, received verification email, the link doesnâ€™t work, the help desk email address provided does not work, cannot set up anything on the app. Stuck in a loop of apologies for not working.... rubbish
The link to verify my email doesnâ€™t work and the app becomes stuck in a loop, cannot register and cannot use the app.
It says it â€œwill only take a jiffyâ€ to register. Iâ€™ve been wasting over an hour trying so far. Tried phoning them but kept on hold for ages so I hung up. Total waste of time for nothing
"Needs a lot of work.
No option to create a password when registering??
Wonâ€™t let you link your reward card after following the simple instructions.
Has not registered any points on my card after Â£40.00 of diesel in my car.
Register today for 250 points hahaha NOTHING???"
After aktualization i can't log inðŸ˜’
"App worked really well at first but for last 3 weeks it will not select the pump and sends error messages.  It could work so much better if the bugs were fixed and staff trained better.

Only one garage has the app facility within my area and the staff have little knowledge on the app. They blamed the network there end to start with and today they told me there is a new app to download which if there is I canâ€™t see it and then why is this bp app still available to download if there is a new app! Iâ€™m guessing there is no new app and the bp staff did not know what she was taking about!

Sort it out BP ðŸ‘ðŸ½"
"Having got the app because Nectar points were no longer available at my local BP station, I was pleased to see what was on offer in the way of rewards with BPâ€™s latest scheme. I downloaded the app and registered, provided my details and went to open the app. It asked for log on details, but I couldnâ€™t log in as I had no password ( it didnâ€™t as for you during registration), I then had to go through the â€œ forgot passwordâ€ procedure to change a password I didnâ€™t actually have?? Got into the app and was awarded 250 points for my troubles, ok I thought little bit of hassle but Iâ€™m good to go now. 
Then came the linking of my rewards card to my new account, looked straight forward enough, all I had to do was input the card number and I was sorted, followed each step and hit the finish buttonâ€ oops somethings gone wrong, please try laterâ€, 48 hours later and Iâ€™m no further on still getting the same message. This had been the week of the launch for BPâ€™s new reward scheme, the very least you would have thought they could have done was made sure that the app was bug free, but itâ€™s atrocious and needs fixing urgently. I was going to try the app to purchase my fuel tonight without having to go in store and face the cue, however I think Iâ€™ll go to Shell.  Do not waste your time with this app."
Tried for over half n hour to register and just kept buffering over and over obviously got teething problems but you would have thought bp would have checked this out first
Unable to link reward card to app, over 12 minutes wait to talk to any body in customer services. Only to to told that there is a problem with the system.
I have updated the up and this is the 3rd time tried to use the pay at pump feature and keeps on saying this is not available have to go into shop can this be sorted out
"This app is a complete waste of time.

The app wouldnâ€™t open when I was in the store with a strong 4g signal. After waiting 2 minutes with the wheel turning I gave up.

Back home tried to link another BP ME card and it wonâ€™t link. Tried neatly 10 times over two days ....

Iâ€™ve given up"
"Always worked for me over last year to fill up and pay, has been great for that.
Only gripe is I tried to register for new loyalty scheme today and app continually states â€œtrying to joinâ€. Another window states â€œlog out and try next timeâ€. I have deleted app and reloaded but my account still has the spinning icon trying to join box. I did this after todayâ€™s update. Not sure if it will correct in time, if not, Iâ€™m stuck! Lost out on my first points todayðŸ˜©"
Oh no!!! For my Nectar card I was able buy nearly everything on Ebuy but now almost nothing from BP store, not hapy so I need change my petrol station to Esso they now takeing Nectar card. Bye Bye BP.
Bring back nectar, nothing works with the new app, canâ€™t add a reward card, canâ€™t find my local BP station, better improve or Iâ€™m going elsewhere
Iâ€™ve been using the app since itâ€™s launch. It has definitely improved, and is now the default way I pay for my fuel. Itâ€™s too early to tell how the new reward scheme will play out. My local BP station is also the closest shop, so I would shop there regularly for groceries. Having the reward card only available inside the app is very clunky. To collect the points the user unlocks their phone, launches the app, logs into the app, navigates to the rewards tab, presses on the scan in store... it just feels very very cumbersome. There should be an option to add the card to the Apple Wallet. The user unlocks the phone, opens Wallet and selects the card.
No way to add to apple wallet !
Since the launch of BPme rewards. You canâ€™t get any points from the app. You will need a new card. I registered new card and ever since when I click on rewards within the app. I get an error message and it just spins like buffering but never does anything. Says it will work the next time you open the app. But thatâ€™s not true. Just get the same error and spinning symbol. Initially put it down to the number of people registering for the new rewards but doubt it. Itâ€™s been 12+ hours
Canâ€™t even link my plastic card to the app! Took over an hour pressing all the buttons and re-entering numbers from the plastic version-still no joy. Shell, Esso- here I come!!ðŸ¤£
Canâ€™t register my loyalty card, despite loads of attempts over several days. Does not inspire loyalty!
Used three times and every time my bank has refused to authorise it.  My card gets stopped, I have to acknowledge the banks txt to activate my card again and go back to the app to unlock the pump.  Quicker to go in and pay.  Get your security sorted!  Now realised the same as other people.  I left the setting at Â£45 even though I only wanted a tenner.  Put in a tenner and Â£45 is on hold in my account.  HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO HOLD ONTO MY MONEY FOR? 10 days is ridiculous!  You need to make this much clearer on the app!
I have no idea how good this app is because it doesnâ€™t work. Iâ€™ve registered but it just sits there trying to Create Rewards Account but to no avail. I have emailed support but no change.
"Well Iâ€™ve registered a card, now Iâ€™ve installed the app. Which seems to hang up trying to create rewards account. Also, refuses to allow me to submit in-app feedback.
What a rubbish app."
"I have tried over dozen times to link my reward card to the app, I have  not even got close to achieving that.  Every time I open the app it tells me I am not near a bp station, and just sits there trying to find a station with no luck.  Itâ€™s only 2 miles from my house in case your interested !

It needs a lot more work before you rolled it out, itâ€™s a shame I had high hopes"
"You would think anyone launching a new reward scheme would ensure it worked before it went live. BP seems to have forgotten this essential part in their planning.
I have been trying to register a reward card through their app for two days only to repeatedly encounter an error message stating the blindingly obvious; that â€˜an error has occurredâ€™.
It still fails even after an update to the app meant to fix the registration problem. Maybe BP should test their systems before throwing them half-baked into the world."
What a terrible app. Doesnâ€™t work properly and just keeps sticking. Should have known it was going to be useless based on the drama it is to download and creat an account!!
"I downloaded it but it is not work .
I canâ€™t get any point"
The reward card I get through the app keeps coming up error, even after the latest update. It wonâ€™t let me link a reward card that Iâ€™ve picked up in the service station
"Canâ€™t use App without allowing it to access my locations services (â€œwhen using appâ€). I donâ€™t use location services, as it drains my iPhone battery plus I donâ€™t want Apple tracking my every move!

So, I canâ€™t use the App. I certainly donâ€™t want to carry yet another store card around in my wallet. 

After 5yrs exclusive custom, Iâ€™ll now be taking my business elsewhere."
"Canâ€™t believe they dropped Nectar. Used to buy my petrol at BP for the points but they have switched to this and I cannot even get the app to download to register the card they gave me.
Buying Shell from now on. Their app is now on my phone"
Says if l signed up today l would receive 250bonus points free,still donâ€™t see my points on my account?
I have used this on numerous occasions usually filling up 2 cars sometimes twice a week and have never had a problem in using it.   Often when using the app, it has saved me from joining a queue at least 8 to 10 people long to pay for my fuel. I am usually in and out inside 90 seconds.  I would thoroughly recommend using the app.
I wanted something simple to replace carrying a loyalty card. The app however refuses to work without location services turned on. Worse as part of the sign up process you get prompted again for marketing emails regardless that you said no when signing up online. Do not get the app, instead keep the bit of plastic in your wallet, it will save you the frustration. Navigation services from the app?! No thank you google maps is perfectly adequate.
Downloaded bp me app but apparently canâ€™t use that to earn rewards on payment/ need a rewards card, tried to use the iOS links to download - they donâ€™t work take you to the App Store and the bp me app, which I already have - pointless
As BP have stopped using Nectar and are now using BPMe I have had to set up an account. The online account works ok but the App will not connect to my account, bringing up an error message â€œSorry, weâ€™ve been unable to complete your registration. Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll try again the next time you log onâ€. The other issue is, because of the first issue, displays â€œ creating rewards accountâ€ and goes no further. Iâ€™ve uninstalled it and tried reinstalling it to no avail. This means I will not be able to collect  any loyalty points unless I have my card with me and that is in my works vehicle. All I want is the app to connect to my account but it doesnâ€™t look like is is going to, which makes the app redundant on my phone so unless there is a fix I will be uninstalling it.
Awful, dreadful app, lost count of how many times I had to login & enter my details, it wouldnâ€™t register my card kept saying there was a problem, so donâ€™t know how many points on my card, also app couldnâ€™t find a BP station just 1 mile from my house. Not worth all the aggravation.
Wanted app to get points on rewards card, it doesnâ€™t work!! Donâ€™t waste your time going through the sign in process on app!
"Linked card to my BPme app but fails when trying to log in most of the time!!
And the rest of the time didnâ€™t recognise my log in
Absolute rubbish waste of time"
Terrible app, can not log in or create reward account, tried submitting feedback through the app and it just says â€œfeedback failedâ€. Failed at the first hurdle BP.
Followed the instructions to the letter but App always advises that it is creating the awards account. Therefore can get no useful information. Rang customer services who confirmed everything alright. Appears to be registering the points but that is it. Half baked.
"I would like my points showing on the app, but the app is saying, unable to connect. 

This happens each time i try to, and at different days, ETC.

Jerry Wright"
"How BP want people to register onto an app that doesnâ€™t fully function.
Keeps indicating setting up rewards account and then error and will retry on return - itâ€™s still not working.
Stick with rewards card and avoid this app."
Last year i used this app to pay for the fuel, they banned me from the petrol station for the non payment even after showing them payment proofs several times. I wouldnâ€™t recommend it. Itâ€™s just the hassle. I tried to submit the feedback on their app and that doesnâ€™t work either
App is very slow to respond. Repeatedly boots you out. Canâ€™t finish set up.
Useless app, canâ€™t link card they give you at store. You have to call and they still canâ€™t sort anything out. Just pointless, why release an app that clearly doesnâ€™t work. You would think a big company like BP could do better than this.
I registered with my new card and itâ€™s still not working they seem to be a lot of technical issues with this new card and app sort it out
This has been so frustrating! BP have stopped accepting Nectar cards so I am trying to register the new BPme card to collect points. The app is difficult to navigate and I keep getting error messages. No idea if I have even managed to register! Tried to give feedback via the app but that also failed. Am not going to entrust my payment details to this as have no faith in its ability to work or keep my details safe. Avoid!
Loaded the app twice each time it froze on the registration rewards bit. Will not be bothering again and will stick to old school method with the swipe card.
"I cannot change my password
I cannot reset my password
Sorry I tried to use the app last time it was not, I could not use it did not work and Iâ€™m not new to IT, I think Iâ€™m changing to Shell."
This app is too slow at the till to use your registered card. It needs to be able to export the card into Apple wallet. Which is very fast and often open when paying.
An absolute cluster ball of an app. Embarrassingly poor. Just doesnâ€™t work. Laughable from BP
Tried 3 times to register card with app, nothing tried to send feedback, nothing . Does this app work?
When paying for my fuel at the garage till, my digital reward card within the BP app wouldnâ€™t scan or be recognised to award my points. The cashier entered my reward card number from the app manually, this hasnâ€™t registered my purchase this way either!!!. Please bring back Nectar as this worked fine???. Oh well of to Tescoâ€™s for my fuel now. At least I will be rewarded for my purchase there!!!. So disappointed with this app and reward system. What reward please???. Whilst in the app, No Service is always present, hence why it doesnâ€™t work possibly, canâ€™t rate the app here, etc.
This app simply doesnt work. Itâ€™s unable to complete my registration and wonâ€™t allow me to view my account. Rubbish!
Doesnâ€™t show my points! Error message only.
I have registered on the BP app, given over all my personal information, verified my email, linked my BP reward card and linked my Nectar card. The iOS app now just sits there saying â€˜creating rewards accountâ€™ and it never does. Have restarted many times and still no joy. So, BP have all my details and I have done all the giving and now BP give me...well...nothing. Donâ€™t waste your time especially as they are always more expensive than Sainsburyâ€™s!
Seems to be a glitch between the App and registration - was hoping to simply use the App card, as with Shell, but seems we will be using (and no doubt forgetting/not having as you get just one card) the loyalty card for some time yet!
Registered new Bp card via the website. Then downloaded app which after logging in says creating rewards account then just hangs. Tried to leave feedback in the app and that comes up with an error message too. Absolute rubbish.
"Abysmal to release such a flaky app. Installation/account registration has just failed on me three times in a row and on the fourth attempt itâ€™s just sits there with its hourglass type icon spinning. 

If this is the only way to collect loyalty points then I will use other fuel providers."
So I managed to download the app and register. But the app won't let me log in. An absolute shambles. Missed nector. Pay swipe and out. This is just a headache. I wanted to check how it works so tried it. BP won't see me again. Unless In emergency. Even that ok try another pump. At start when I logged in. Fine then kicks you out. Done this to me all day. Waste of time and money.
"The app wonâ€™t even show the petrol station even though Iâ€™m at the pump.
Had to go old school and go inside to pay. What is the point of this app?"
Be me ??? No thanks !! Registered on line with new card then decided to download app ... wish I hadnâ€™t bothered... useless... didnâ€™t accept my details, registration or password!! Frustrating and pointless!
This app does not pull the card numbers from your online account and keeps saying itâ€™s failed to create a rewards account. The app also fails to let you submit feedback. Please sort it out as it is frustrating.
Rubbish and completely pointless! Have registered but just will not let me login! Useless!
"Firstly, this doesnâ€™t work. My local BP station, equipped with the latest pumps, always gives an error message that there are no pumps available even when my car is the only one on the forecourt.
Secondly, the feedback feature (hidden away in the settings, curiously) ironically gives a feedback submission failed message.
Utterly useless compared with the simplicity and reliability of the Esso offering."
"Looks like Iâ€™ll be deleting this. Keeps saying Creating Rewards Account and fails every time.

Therefore I can not see my rewards unless I log in on the website.

I swear Software is getting worse and more unreliable lately.

Edit: it wonâ€™t even let me leave a review within the App. Keeps saying â€œfailedâ€"

Signed up, registered, went to log in but never gets past the log in screen. Unless someone makes this work properly shortly, Iâ€™m outðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸
"The first thing youâ€™ll notice is the horrendously drawn out registration process.

Then, even after downloading the app and creating an account, I can (seemingly) have the barcode within the app scanned to get points, but you have to link and register a physical card in order to get the 250 initial registration points.  Plus, neither the app or website will let me register the physical card...keeps saying â€˜An error has occurredâ€™.  Very useful error message.

At least, thatâ€™s what I think you have to do, because the instructions are absolutely awful.

The other huge annoyance is that you CANNOT use the app without enabling your GPS and giving the app access to your location.  I donâ€™t have my GPS permanently enabled and might not want the app accessing my location.  Why on earth didnâ€™t the devs just disable the location specific parts of the app if the deviceâ€™s GPS is disabled (like most other apps with location specific functions)?  From a CX perspective (Customer eXperience), this is a laughable."
App. Can't register the new reward
"So firstly the app will only open if connected to WiFi! 

Then I have been collecting points up using my card but Iâ€™ve been waiting 8 days now and most of the points still arenâ€™t showing. Also the app doesnâ€™t show you where points are collected or on what date, so you canâ€™t track anything! Totally Useless app"
Just filled up, got the new card, register card well, 2 hours later after putting in all required details, nothing, tried down loading the app, nothing. Waste of time, card in the bin.
"Tried to send this feedback but it â€œfailedâ€. Sums up the app really!

Was told I would get 250 points if I registered today. Also that card had been scanned when I paid for fuel. No evidence of either! Nightmare to set up. Not very impressed so far."
Doesn't work. Downloaded, registered, verified, and the app just doesn't do anything - opens on the log in page, accepts credentials, thinks about it then returns to the log in page. Waste of my time. I'll go to Shell instead
What a rubbish app, wonâ€™t let me add a reward card to the app, just keeps saying something has gone wrong!!
"The app is pants. The email system is pants. The helpline is pants. Got the app and every time I try to get into it it says something is wrong. Contacted by phone answer machine keeps advising me to go online and register for BPme which Iâ€™ve done so emailed the problem and get an email thanking me for my interest in the app. 
Waste of time."
"â€œSomething went wrong. Please try again laterâ€

TruÃµes a couple times during this week and still the same problem."
Tried this app today, it didnâ€™t work and blocked my RBS debit card
"The first time my wife used this app she couldnâ€™t verify her payment  card. App deleted. 6 months later, new phones, we thought weâ€™d give it another go.

My wife is unable to login as it wonâ€™t accept her motherâ€™s maiden name with or without a capital letter. No option to sort it.

I canâ€™t verify my payment option. We are both pretty tech savvy. 

Needs work."
This app wonâ€™t log me in after Iâ€™ve set it all up stays on the log in page
I eventually got my card activated after the app initially wouldnâ€™t let me so I filled up the following week and presented my card along with a voucher I was given previously for 150 points to the attendant. That was 3 days ago and I still havenâ€™t had the points added to my card.  No wonder BP are getting so many bad reviews for this app when their customers arenâ€™t getting what theyâ€™re promised!
Iâ€™m less than a mile away ! Location services on my iPhone XS for BPme enabled ðŸ™„
"I like the app and like using it but since my email address has changed I canâ€™t use it because receipts got to my old email address and the app does not give you any opportunity to update your email address as itâ€™s locked 
unless this gets resolved my review is two stars"
The app worked the first couple of times, now it just says thereâ€™s a problem try again or pay in kiosk, complete waste of time
This app is rubbish still canâ€™t link a reward card even after update.
App looks neat enough but I never trust an application for which the terms indicate location is optional but then forces you to enable location service to use it. After sign up the app presents the screen for â€˜Please allow location servicesâ€™ and the only option is to enable. Since this app is intended to support some payment related activities lack of trust is significant hence two stars.
Just tried to sign up for the first time and it is way too complicated. I am never ever going to give my card details to anyone and commit to using it every time. I shall use the next garage along the road and stick with nectar.
My BPme account wonâ€™t load on app just keeps saying error
"Had this app for about 6 months and never actually managed to get it to open. Always says â€œsomething went wrongâ€. Tried the usual uninstall/reinstall and no change. 
Annoying at best"
Couldnâ€™t get passed setting the 4 digit pin code during Registration setup. It would then say e-mail address already registered and dump me back to login screen unable to Register or Login. Seems like a few bugs need to be sorted out.
Asks me for security question and I answer and press confirm and it says error. Useless.
Piece of absolute c***. Endless faults and hangs on set up. Worthless. Will try esso or shell.
Great so far but Iâ€™d much prefer the App to support Apple Pay instead of my card number being stored.
Takes an age to login due to being slow (donâ€™t have the same issue with nectar app login so not an issue with my broadband speed). Canâ€™t seem to find itemised list of when my points are added just the total. Really poor app Iâ€™m afraid. When I then submitted this feedback on the app itself it says submission failed so canâ€™t even give them my feedback. Sums it up really.
Absolute piece of rubbish if your going to release software can you please ensure itâ€™s actually tested before releasing it! My wife works at BP and gave me a new BP my rewards card to activate all I get is â€œsomething went wrong. Please try again laterâ€ spent hours on the phone to support they just blame apple because of recent updates they advised me to try logging onto the website on a pc which Iâ€™ve tried countless times and refuses to log in saying something went wrong. Utter rubbish!
Not any good so far.  I tried to pay using the app, but I got a 'we're having technical difficulties' pop-up message.  Very disappointing.
Canâ€™t use the app to redeem points whilst paying for fuel, annoying as I donâ€™t always have my wallet with me. No key ring cards available. And the app wonâ€™t find my nearest no garage which happens to be 0.3 miles from my house.
Unintuitive, difficult to register, have to add cards by the web interface, and slow to start when you open at a petrol station (so slow it normally holds the queue up while wait for it to open). To cap it all the service station they then give you paper vouchers to get bonus points !
Iâ€™ve tried to link my wifeâ€™s reward card to my account but it doesnâ€™t work. I have tried using the app and the website but no luck. Just get â€œan error has occurredâ€
Picked up a card today and downloaded the app, enter name and email address and.......nothing just a never ending circle â˜¹ï¸
"Despite having a fully functioning account with BPme Rewards with a card linked which works perfectly fine on the website, after signing in to the app Iâ€™m prompted to â€˜join rewardsâ€™ which upon clicking, tries to load before crashing. 
Still the same after several reinstalls.

Contacting BP results in â€˜Iâ€™m sorry, weâ€™re awaiting another update from the app developer.â€™"
"If I could give this zero stars, I would. The app is completely and utterly useless. Got the third time in a week it has failed. Latest attempt allowed me to put 21p in a petrol can before stopping. Previous two attempts resulted in error message.

Will only use Shell now - their app always works."
App is a great idea and looks pretty good. Unfortunately I am unable to link my BPme reward card after continued attempts to do so. Update please!
Good idea but doesnâ€™t work. Even the feedback page on the app doesnâ€™t work and filling station staff know nothing about it. Avoid and go to Esso.
Was good, now rubbish as it wonâ€™t let me login. Just says something went wrong please try again. Fed up trying to make it work
I really like using the app to fill up my car with fuel, the only problem I have with the app is after filling my car up my rewards points donâ€™t automatically go onto my card, I ring BPme customer service spend half hour on the phone to be told that they can add all my points I have missed for me and there is still an app issue which they are trying to fix. All I can say is if itâ€™s broke then donâ€™t try and push people to use it.
This app is slower than standing in a full queue, great idea but needs work
This app is constantly letting me down. The latest bug is Iâ€™m able to choose the fuel station but doesnâ€™t allow to choose the pump. Interestingly, I tried to submit my feedback through the app and it too failed. The app is full of bugs. Do you even have a test team ?
The hype all sounds good. But after registration success it usually takes 5 attempts to log in. First I have to enter my email then click in the password box & use touch (which is enabled). Nope - Doesnâ€™t recognise,  repeat, then it sees my password but has removed the email - back to square one. More of the same then â€˜Kerchingâ€™ Iâ€™m in. I click to load X2 points and it says cannot execute. Whatâ€™s the opposite of Ultimate?
The app has clearly been rushed to get update for bp me. It doesnâ€™t work. Plus I need to spend Â£1000â€™s to be rewarded a pencil! Wonâ€™t be using!
"Thus will be as good as Shell go+ system if they can sort out the bug that is causing you to go around in circles when logging in. Will not allow me to login on the app but I can access my account on the internet. 
Cmon team letâ€™s sort this out and Iâ€™ll up my stars to a five as it is good using it online.
Four days now Iâ€™m still waiting for the update. Donâ€™t ask me to contact so and so Iâ€™ve already done this. Cannot access app. Cannot use card on my phone. Times ticking!
As always on all apps replies! Read what I've done? I've contacted your team already! Sort out the app problem I'm not the only one with this issue!"
"This app makes you have location services on to use the app. 

Only trying to see how much I have in my account and things and itâ€™s making me turn it on. 

Find this super annoying!!"
"It works - eventually. Registering a card seems hit and miss. But launching an app like this on iPhone in 2019 without Apple Wallet or Apple Pay support seems baffling to me. 

Youâ€™re better off just using a plastic card, which seems a terrible missed opportunity."
This BPme App doesnâ€™t work, the website does not work, customer services donâ€™t know what they are doing.
Ok halfway there. At least I donâ€™t have to wait behind people paying for shopping, itâ€™s just waiting for those people to move their cars away from the pumps!
Set up slow and awkward due to repeated need to enter email and password which are not remembered by the app.
This app needs a proper review and update. Always very slow to open. Always logging out. In modern phone technology this should not happen. You guys need to learn from your competitors.
I canâ€™t get this to work. I can be sitting in the car next to the pump and the app will tell me: â€œIt doesnâ€™t look like youâ€™re near a station.â€ On the one occasion it agreed I WAS in a station, it refused to let me pay. â€œLooks like something went wrong,â€ it kept saying. I tried three times and eventually gave up and joined the queue at the till. Now my purchase history doesnâ€™t show on the app, of course. BP needs to ask CaffÃ¨ Nero how to build and run an intuitive, customer friendly app. This certainly isnâ€™t one.
Good app, would be nice next update to be able to add the rewards code/card to wallet on iPhone. So instead of going to the app and this would be easier on the wallet.
Keeps spinning a loading symbol, canâ€™t register. Definitely not easy peasy.
Donâ€™t bother, it takes so long to open the app then to navigate round it just to scan, if you donâ€™t mind holding up the queue or are using it at night I guess it would be ok
Why did it not fill up to the amount requested? Itâ€™s always 50p less. I require Â£10 but only received Â£9.50?
"The app doesnâ€™t remember me and asks me to log in every time. This is an inconvenience when it takes a minute or so when others are waiting. 

The last time I gave up after 3 minutes (which is a long time to keep a queue waiting- so lost my â€œrewardsâ€)

Now it doesnâ€™t want to log me in at all. 

Poor attempt at an app."
"Great idea as I use BP a lot, but I use the app as a card and it takes ages to access as after I use Apple Pay to pay for the fuel, you then have to Face ID, then wait for offers to load before accessing the card. This takes too long in a busy store with a queue of people behind, so I donâ€™t tend to bother. Twice I have and the points havenâ€™t appeared on my account.
Will hopefully improve with time."
Don't pay using this app! It's debits your account by Â£100 whatever you eventually pay for your fuel and then doesn't credit your account for 10 days! When the money's back on my account the app is coming off my phone!
Not very good this App doesnâ€™t keep a log of your purchases and is so slow in updating your points. You canâ€™t keep a track on your points spend so BP could actually con you in not awarding points
"It seems the last three times the app has been less than useful - as in unusable.

The first of the last three issues, I filled up and the app hung, suggesting the payment couldnâ€™t be processed and to head in to the store instead.

The second time, the app seemingly forgot it was signed in and sent me to the login screen, which I didnâ€™t have time to resolve in a busy forecourt.

The third time, the app suggested there were no pumps available. The pump I was parked at looked available unless I existed in another dimension. Also there were other pumps free at the time.

I like the concept of the app, and it started out well, but Iâ€™ve failed to accrue any points the last three times visiting BP because of these issues. Also, it seems discussing issues with the app with staff at any BP garage results in shrugging and a blank facial expression, suggesting training is lacking somewhat.

I like the concept of this app, please let these just be teething problems."
Has â€œAWâ€ not read what folks are saying?? This app was great until BPme card.... canâ€™t even log in app. Continually asking me to update terms etc then bounces back to same page!!!! Absolutely rubbish. Only used BP for the convenience of not having to bring the kids into station to pay. Sort it out please. Shell do such a better job!
can anyone help? After ticking new terms and conditions the home screen opens and straight away reloads the tick new terms and conditions page. Iâ€™ve tried deleting and re downloading the app but the same happens.
Downloaded and was setting up but the app wonâ€™t let me accept TS and CS.  I tick to accept and then confirm but the screen just reverts to the same screen with boxes unticked.   I give up.
Love to use your app, great idea but Iâ€™m not willing to let you store my card details so wonâ€™t be using. Pretty simple, allow Apple Pay in app.
After login the t&cs appear. I read them and tick boxes and click confirm. They go. I see the next screen and then up pops the unchecked t&cs. Sort of ground hog days of apps.
"....but I canâ€™t get past the t&c and privacy tick boxes! So frustrating!!!

Currently unusable."
For some reason it wonâ€™t let me accept the terms and conditions. Therefore this app to me is useless. It used to work!
I give your app one star I would have given it zero stars if there was a choice it is rubbish donâ€™t waste your time getting it . It never works
Unable to sign into the app as it crashes every time I accept the terms and conditions
Really all that money and your app is useless.....best who ever you hired for the job better up there game or lose them.
App wonâ€™t let you accept updated T&Câ€™s so frustrating!!!!
Iâ€™ve used this app many times but itâ€™s clunky, slow and crash. The latest version is useable - I cannot get past the T&Câ€™s tick box - when complete and confirmed it just â€œbouncesâ€ back to the same tick box. Iâ€™ve reinstalled, changed passwords, checked my profile but it just down not work. Terrible for a company like BP not to have done their due diligence on something that makes a fundamental change to their business models - atrocious.
Iâ€™m in an eternal loop of being asked to confirm the terms and conditions and privacy policy. Ticking the boxes, pushing confirm and then getting the same again. Iâ€™ve given it two stars because it used to work well but the addition of the me rewards seems to have broken it.
Good little app , shows everything you need , is very slow at opening and getting going though. Also a bit annoying that you NEED location services switched on to be able to get into it even if you are or go to youâ€™re regular fuel station anyway , â€œAdd card to walletâ€ would be a good feature really.
Iâ€™ve just wasted ten minutes trying to log in. The app asks me repeatedly to accept Ts&Cs then a screen flash tells me Iâ€™m not near a petrol station before asking me to accept the Ts&Cs again. Iâ€™ve logged out and logged back in and itâ€™s the same.
App no longer works. Will not go past T&Câ€™s!!!
You canâ€™t get beyond the privacy statement. Iâ€™ve accepted it, tried deleting the app and reinstalling, accepting again. Nothing works.
I cannot accept / confirm the new terms & conditions and privacy statement so therefore the app is not working! Frustrating!
Canâ€™t get past new T&Cs screen.
"Despite my home town having  two nearby stations and my workplace having one, station finder reports none in the vicinity

In fact when I entered a search on Leeds was also informed none in vicinity, seems strange that BP donâ€™t have a outlet anywhere in such a large city. Wouldnâ€™t rely on this when travelling far"
Gets stuck at accepting new t&c and privacy statement. Keeps looping back to the beginning. Useless.
"Now canâ€™t get passed the account updates screen which has two tick boxes for agreeing to T&Câ€™s and Privacy policy. I tick the boxes then click the confirm button and it brings me straight back to the same screen with the boxes unticked! 
Repeated this about 20 times over the last couple of days and still not working!"
Change of terms and privacy statement updates causing app to loop back to accept changes once accepted and continue button pressed rendering app useless
I have been unfortunately unable to use the app to fuel my car up. This is due to some sort of fault or glitch in the app as no matter how many times I try to accept the privacy policy and T&Cs it brings me back to the â€˜account updatesâ€™ screen almost instantaneously, thus preventing my use of the app
Canâ€™t get past the privacy and terms and conditions tick boxes!!
Useless as cannot log in and get OST terms and conditions pop up. Been occurring for weeks now BP. Already lost my custom to Shell as a result.
Canâ€™t even get past agreeing to the t&c page to use the app, despite several fresh installs.
Keeps going back to the page requiring you to accept terms and conditions and privacy policy agreement; cannot use the app beyond this.
While I try for the umpteenth time to agree to the terms and privacy statement. Stuck on a stupid loop.
"I used this app without issues for several months. However, it now asks me to accept Ts & Cs and the privacy statement, and logs in, but instantly logs out again, and asks the same question over & over. Tried deleting and re-downloading to no avail. 
Not sure if others are having the same issue, but until it is fixed it is useless to me."
Not sure how many time I have to accept Ts&Cs. Keep submitting and the pop up come straight back up again
Having used the app a few times successfully I now find that it will not process past the screen where I approve privacy settings, click to go to the next screen and straight back to the same one. I have emailed direct and see from other forums there are many others having the same problem. 2 weeks on and no update from BP. How to make customers go elsewhere!!
New customers will get caught in a loop trying to agree terms and conditions. Such a shame.
Using iPhone 8 and I canâ€™t get past the terms and conditions acceptance page. I check both boxes, click submit and it instantly pops up again every time. I have emailed the support team but have had not reply for nearly two weeks!
App has stopped working. It keeps asking me to accept terms and conditions and even if I do, it doesnâ€™t let me select a station. Just goes back to the terms and conditions page. Before it was great.
Dreadful
"Unable to pass the Terms and conditions after inserting my credentials. The application will keep asking me in a loop to agree. 

Tried to register my new points card online but is not working either, I had to contact support. 

Very unreliable system."
Used it once ok but now canâ€™t get past the account update screen - I tick to accept new T&C etc and confirm but same screen then pops back up. Iâ€™ll be deleting the app as itâ€™s unworkable. Shame because it was a good idea.
Updated to new version. Doesnâ€™t even let you except the terms and conditions. App was poor before update now doesnâ€™t work.
Works well when it works. Which isnâ€™t often. The challenge is with login. There are occasions when the login fails - and then succeeds with the same credentials. There is a big question over why it logs users out so frequently. Then there is the fact that the app doesnâ€™t save passwords to Keychain - a real challenge when you use strong passwords. It wonâ€™t reliably request TouchID or FaceID as an alternative either. And the password reset process is very patchy. I love apps that streamline life. This isnâ€™t one of them.
"Iâ€™ve been a BP customer for decades so Iâ€™m disappointed to find that I canâ€™t register on the app. Whenever I accept the privacy statement and ts and cs, I select â€˜confirmâ€™ and it takes me back to the same page in a never ending loop and wont let me progress.
Customer services are undermining me by telling me to make sure I have the latest version of the app - I can accept hearing that once but come on.
Disappointing."
Canâ€™t get past the T&C agreement!! Same problem for ages yet theyâ€™ve supposedly released an update yesterday! Really poor and not fit for purpose.
Iâ€™ve waited for the update assuming it would fix the T&Cs and Privacy issue and amazingly it still doesnâ€™t work. Does anyone read these reviews before releasing updates?
"Iâ€™ve registered this app with my new card as I can no longer used my Nectar card at BP.  However I canâ€™t use the app in store as there is no bar code to scan showing.  Iâ€™ve tried reloading the all but itâ€™s still the same so itâ€™s useless. 

Please fix this problem!!!"
Itâ€™s too slow to load up. You should be able to press the app and the barcode appear but it Takes ages which is not great with other customers waiting
Requires user to accept updated T&Cs, but wonâ€™t register acceptance. Canâ€™t use it at all now.
Something is broken which needs to be fixed...
Still not working after update. Takes you back to terms and conditions all the time.
The app doesnâ€™t let me accept the T&Câ€™s and itâ€™s not working properly! Please sort this issue out ASAP
The privacy and terms boxes keeps comes back after you hit continue.
"It takes ages to open the app and doesnt load.

It regularly wont allow you to display your barcode scannable points card.

Also if you sign up for a card on this app they do not send you a points card out."
Great for having a digital reward card, mapping you to a station, paying for fuel.... but one gripe, having two stations only a mile or so apart in my town, why canâ€™t the fuel prices be shown in the station info via the map?  For the sake of a mile I could pay 4p/litre less for diesel... mounts up when a full tank is around Â£100. If I was travelling and unaware there was another cheaper station close by, having that info could be handy
I have used the app for the last 6 months and found it really useful. Since upgrading my iPhone though it is now totally unusable. On logging in I canâ€™t get past the terms and conditions. Every time I check the check boxes and hit the button it goes back to the ts and cs and there is no way around it. I have removed the app and re installed. Think Iâ€™m best off just dumping it now.
"Tried to use this late at night when the station was shut and only had the night window. I had already filled up the car - no idea if you can actually use the app after you have filled up (the same way you would actually pay normally in the station or with pay at pump!) most people seem to talk about using the app to unlock the pump so I guess not? After setting up an account, validating via email, setting my security question, setting a pin (really, does it really need another pin to remember?), setting Face ID, I tried to pay - doesnâ€™t show the amount I had put in the car and instead tries to charge me Â£100 (well, auth Â£100 I assume it will settle me what I have used once it figures it out). I then had to authorise it my banking app (not the BP apps fault, but frustrating), which then declined it! (Again making an already frustrating, experience more frustrating, again not necessarily BPâ€™s fault). At this point I gave up and went to pay at the night window. I see 3 major problems with this app:

- usage is still really unclear whether I can put petrol in before I pay or have to mess around on the app before I fill up
- the Â£100 auth thing is a joke. Either let me set the amount by default or auth the actual amount used (this might not be possible if you have to auth before you fill up, which is a stupid design if so)
- the sign up process takes way too long with much more security than it needs. I donâ€™t need a pin on this app - I pay for things with plenty of other apps that donâ€™t have pins - there is no extra need for this app to have one

Will not use again"
Running app on iPhone 6s with latest available software. The app will not let me past the screen where you accept the T's and C's. After clicking accept, it disappears off-screen for a second then reappears. Unusable! Tested on girlfriends iPhone and exactly the same issue recurred.
"As per number of recent reviews - login stuck in perpetual loop and cannot get beyond the t&cs screen! Sort it out otherwise off to Esso Iâ€™m afraid.

Even tried emailing your support team! Automated Response says â€˜we may or may not get back to you if we are busyâ€™ most unbelievable response I have ever seen. Zero customer service!!"
Used a couple of times, then had the payment fail because bank declined transaction, a problem others have seen. Now Iâ€™m stuck on a recurring screen of accepting updated T&Cs. Tesco doesnâ€™t have any of these problems, just saying.
Really very convenient service
The app doesnâ€™t even get passed the terms and conditions.
Since the app was updated it now crashes constantly when I go to find out how much is on the card. Deleted the app and put back on same results
This app no longer works. A request you to confirm agreement to new terms and conditions and privacy statement however when you press confirm it does something in the background and then just brings up the screen again. Attempting to take the relevant boxes and confirm again does the same processing is on a continuous loop so you can never progress to finding your nearest BP station. Completely on usable as a result. Tried relaunching the app and deleting and installing again, however nothing works. Very disappointing.
Registered as per instructions.  Now app wonâ€™t open - useless.
App doesnâ€™t work when I log in just takes me back to the original screen asking to register or log in. If o can log in doesnâ€™t give me an option to register my card or redeem any points, COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT!!!!
Canâ€™t even get past accepting terms and conditions you tick it then it wonâ€™t go past that page absolute Mickey Mouse!!!!!
Like many others app stuck in constant loop at terms and conditions and simply impossible to use. Given up and gone to Shell, there app works. I hardly take my wallet out these days so rely on these apps to work.
When I log in it throws up new conditions, so click accept but it just throws the new conditions back up.  So canâ€™t access the app at all.  The app needs work!
The idea of not having to go in and pay is great when you have babies in the car. However. Every time I go to use it, it comes up with a page to accept terms and conditions. When you tick it and accept, it goes away then comes straight back so you can't actually use it. Also when using the specific amount option, if I put Â£10 for example, it stops at around Â£8!! The app could be really good but I feel it really does need some work on it.
"The App will present you with New T&Cs and Privacy Policy tick boxes to agree to - youâ€™ll never get past these. Theyâ€™ll just repeatedly be re-presented to you. An aggravating waste of time. The team developing this app really need to invest time in testing it! Totally unusable!
Canâ€™t even register BPME card via web either â€œsorry an error occurredâ€ REPEATEDLY. Sort it out!
STILL NOT FIXED - unbelievably ignorant approach to customers. Please just take this app off the App Store and come back when it works."
Wow, drive up, park up, open app, fill up and your done.
"App is slow to load up. When it eventually does, it makes me login even though iâ€™d previously set it to log me in through Touch ID.
After finally managing to log in, itâ€™s stuck in a continuous loop.
Wonâ€™t be using it again. Awful! Wouldnâ€™t give the app any stars if I could!"
Trying to use the app but every time I try and agree the privacy points it reverts back and asks me to agree the privacy points. Contacted BP, no reply!
App continually crashes. Keeps asking me to agree privacy statement and terms (which I do) but keeps resetting. Useless at the moment.
"Never works when you are actually on the forecourt. Latest is it keeps asking me to accept privacy changes so I check the boxes and say confirm and it keeps looping back to that page. I gave up and paid the old-fashioned way.

/edit. Updated today, 30th July 2019. Still stuck in the T&C loop like everyone else. Updated the app and they still havenâ€™t fixed the app-breaking bug that everyone is reporting. Waste of time."
"Cannot login. Will not let you past ticking terms box and keeps resetting. Received an email saying logged in from different device - never used on any other device and only ever on this phone.
Quicker to go in and pay."
Can't get part the acceptance of terms and conditions like others so this is therefore useless.
Also getting a loop and canâ€™t get past accepting the terms and conditions.
Just downloaded the new version of the app and it says privacy terms have been updated and I need to accept them before using the app. Ticked all the boxes and accepted same thing saying the term updates came out again. Tried about 10 times clicking accept and the same window kept coming out. Give up.
Used to work, other than NatWest continuing to block it but now inoperable as doesnâ€™t get past the privacy agreement. Tick both boxes to agree and just goes back to the start again. Tried deleting and reloading, same issue. So useless
This once brilliant app is totally unusable because you canâ€™t get past the T&Cs. All contact with care line is ignored in spite of promises to respond to emails or call back.
Great app previously now itâ€™s useless as every time I access it, it tells me to accept the new terms and conditions and privacy statement. I check both boxes to accept, press confirm and it immediately takes me back to the accept page again. Cannot get past that page despite trying over ten times on different occasions. Please sort it out!
"Since having the app have been unable to check my rewards. Constantly crashes when I click on it. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still same problem. Seems to need an update but none available.

Wouldnâ€™t recommend until patch available."
"I had been using this app quite happily without issues for filling up at my local BP station.
However, the previous version and current version of the app have stopped working, which I discovered when I went to fill my car with fuel and the app kept looping after login back to the screen to agree to the policies. Ever since, I canâ€™t progress beyond these screens, rendering the app useless!"
"Okay, I work in software, I know some bugs are difficult to track down. But your team are now looking like incompetents: The same Ts&Cs bug is in this version as in the past two. 

Steps to reproduce:
Start app
Tap login
Enter username and password
Briefly see page saying Iâ€™m not near a garage
Get presented with Ts&Cs page
Tick both boxes
Tap confirm
Same Ts&Cs and page appears. 

I canâ€™t make it clearer: Fix your QA or go home. This is embarrassing."
"Canâ€™t get past the blasted T&C acceptance screen for the rewards. I tick accept in both boxes, click continue, it disappears, and keeps coming straight back up again!

Also, why doesnâ€™t it let my iPhone automatically enter the ads word from keychain?! The phone tries to, but the app wonâ€™t let the fields populate. 

Seems very poorly written."
"Update August 1

BP have released another update 1.54.2 which they claim fixes the registration problems.    No it doesnâ€™t.    Still canâ€™t get past the T&Câ€™s.    And yes, I deleted and redownloaded the App.

What a mess.

Update July 26

Following release of BPâ€™s update 1.52.2, which claimed to fix the registration problems, have deleted and re-downloaded the App, only to find that nothing has changed and that I still canâ€™t get past the T&Câ€™s.

Still no point in using BP.    They are a shambles.

Initial post

Have tried to use this App on an iPhone Xs running iOS 12.3.1 but canâ€™t get past the â€œAccept Terms and Conditionsâ€ section.   Every time I click to accept then press â€œcontinueâ€, it works for a nano second then the â€œAccept Terms and Conditionsâ€ page pops up again and I canâ€™t get past it.   The App also does not work with Keychain.   Have deleted and reinstalled to no avail.    No point in using BP when they canâ€™t provide a working App."
"Soon after I downloaded the app it was announced that BP was leaving the Nectar scheme. I have never used the app and now never will. Reading other reviews I am pleased about that. All I want now is to close my account but there is no way to do that in the app.
EDIT tried on the website but it stops trying to log in and nothing happens."
Since update I get a screen saying you have updated terms and privacy policy. I click to accept, it briefly goes to front page then goes back to the terms and privacy notice again. It wonâ€™t let me accept them so Iâ€™m stuck and canâ€™t use the app.
"Great app, however, for a few patches now Iâ€™ve been unable to get passed the â€œAccept Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policyâ€ screen. I tick the boxes and press the confirm box, the screen goes down to show the select a location screen and immediately comes back up and the same steps repeat continuously. 

Looked for App Support but have been unable to find anything. Shame."
Payment with PayPal when, like Esso and Shell?
Many of the BP stores are closed but even after many months has passed the app still shows pumps as fully Woking. Needs to fix or update the store finder list more frequently. Otherwise app is good.
"I havenâ€™t used the paying features. But trying to get the reward card to open up takes forever. Itâ€™s very hit and miss as to whether itâ€™ll open and more often than not I simply give up. A common problem Iâ€™m told by staff.
Being able to add the card to Apple Wallet would save a lot of phaffing about."
"The app is good but it doesn't store the BPMe card offline in the apple wallet so if you are not in a great place for signal you have to hold up the queue waiting for the card to load before it can be used. 

Also if you want to remove a card from your account because it's been lost you can't do this via the app. You have to go to the BPMe rewards website (not the BP website)"
Can the barcode be added to apple wallet? If so, how?
This app is a start.  Needs faster loading sometimes takes ages.  It needs ability to add card to apple wallet as sometime low coverage area card doesn't load.  Also, don't understand need to download offers.
Takes far too long to load, especially the Rewards section. You can spend an embarrassing long time at the checkout waiting for this to open to claim your points. Come on speed this open, compared to Nectar app for example this is snail pace.
"Iâ€™ve been using this app successfully for a while and have found it very useful, however today I cannot get it to work. It is asking me to accept the new privacy statement and terms & conditions but after doing so and clicking confirm the dialog goes away and then comes back a second or two later. This continues in an endless cycle despite restarting the app, logging out and in again etc.
I give this app a high rating but if this is not fixed quickly Iâ€™ll have to downgrade to a 1-star rating.
EDIT: the issue above has now been fixed ðŸ™‚"
Disappointed with the loading of the app. Now a lots errors comes along as well. Try fix the speed of the app.
The app is slow and unresponsive. I donâ€™t use it to pay just to collect the points. I can feel the queue building up behind me as the card to swipe doesnâ€™t appear. Now Iâ€™m back in the office to check my balance and the app fails to load current information. Almost useless. Find a fix quick please!!
After several updates this app still has many bugs.
I like the app however it rarely loads the rewards up properly. Iâ€™ve loaded rewards to my card when they have come up but it never has added the extra points it said it would. It only does if you get a print out reward offer. Very frustrating. Must be a glitch. Otherwise once thats improved it will be a five star rating from me.
Iâ€™ve given it 3stars because when first launched BPme rewards it was working fantastically, but since the update no rewards are shown on my account just keeps saying try later been like this the update.
Oh dear. This app is still unreliable. Yesterday I tried to use it but when attempting to select my pump number it said â€œApplogies, there appear to be no pumps available right nowâ€. This was despite the forecourt being nearly empty of cars. Hope you can sort this out, BP.
"I loaded all my BPme rewards but now when I view them on the app it just says â€œsorry couldnâ€™t loadâ€

When more than one rewards is loaded I canâ€™t tell which is next to be used which isnâ€™t helpful.

Donâ€™t use the pay for fuel feature as seems a stupid idea. I prefer no hassle walk 5-10 ft to pay inside instead."
"Got new card tried to add to app but keeps on coming up with error message pointless to create a rewards card and app that donâ€™t work together... website seems to work registering card.

After BP sent out a update can register card but pay at pump not working still"
Working well ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰
Frustrating as when I go to pay for fuel the â€˜rewardsâ€™ offers donâ€™t load up. It says.... â€˜sorry we couldnâ€™t load your BPme rewards offers please try again laterâ€™ just as Iâ€™m about to pay for fuel on more than 4 occasions. Please fix the bug cheers
Since having the app, the balance doesnâ€™t update, I canâ€™t update my account details, canâ€™t pay for fuel from the app. Yes Iâ€™ve had signal at the time. There needs to be some major service upgrades to fix the problems.
Meny bug
Doesnâ€™t work with Apple Keychain...bit pointless.
Downloaded the app filled in my info and waited for email to confirm.  However this never arrived so tried again but they said an account with same email address was already in use. Deleted app and tried again, and again, but each time I never received the email to authorise the account! Waste of time
I like the concept of this app. I do not like BP abandoning my nectar loyalty. That said, my main issue is each time I arrive at a forecourt and open the BPme app, it asks me to log in. If Iâ€™m sitting on my sofa at home it will open without any issue whatsoever. So to re-log in and go thru the whole process, it takes way longer than actually paying by card for fuel at the desk. Defeats the object. Perhaps these apps are written without any road testing?
Contacted by the developer and answer given for the issue I faced. (Unable to move on from a stuck T&Câ€™s screen). Looks like a recent update fixed. Fair play to devs for taking time to reply, most donâ€™t! Now finding the app very useful.
App does not open, so slow unable to load rewards.
Takes ages to load and fetch data regardless of on 4G or WIFi. Useless app
Having contacted customer services, who were NO help, this still does not work and refers to an â€˜Unknown Errorâ€™. Terrible.
"Hi
How do I bypass the enable location access screen please ? I do not wish to allow location access and wish to see my points status. Iâ€™m not interested in using it to pay at the pump so location is not required. I would just like to see my points status"
This app only logs in when Iâ€™m not at a fuel station. Iâ€™ve tried twice now, two different fuel stations, and both times Iâ€™ve ended up going inside to pay as the app will not log in.  Yet sat at home it goes straight in to tell me Iâ€™m not near a fuel station - umm I know!!!!
Amazing time saving way to refuel. I often get to the petrol station and the attendants are rude and there is a queue. With this app it cuts out the need to go to the counter as I often fill up late at night which requires you to pay before you put fuel in. Such a great way time efficient way to add value to your day. Canâ€™t thank you guys enough for making this app as refuelling has always been a bane of my existence.
...itâ€™s a bit flaky. Often says â€œunable to load rewardsâ€ so I have resorted to the good old fashioned way of using the actual card and the paper receipts with the rewards (extra points etc). Good for advising when I am near a garage (when the phone signal is good enough)
This is the most pointless App in the pointless App competition. Never works never remembers your password causes queues in the petrol station. Just do away with it, it is just useless.
"Put my details in on line,including password. Tried to log in twice,was told there was an error and to phone up. Got a semi-unintelligible Scottish voice (which is very unusual) followed by a semi-unintelligible Indian voice owned by a man called Arthur (!!). 
Arthur wanted all sorts of other details from me but Iâ€™d lost the will to live by then and GAVE UP. I already get rewards whenever I use my credit card anyway and I just couldnâ€™t be a--ed to be honest!"
I signed up and registered my card to pay at pump but it wonâ€™t let me open the app it says account suspended! Yet I can enter my account on safari !! Waste of time
I set up app from start but can not use it as the account is blocked.  This was having reset the account and password several times.  Emails to customer care line are not answered and the helpline only operates Monday to Thursday 9-5pm.
This app is really good. Just that the first time filled up using the app I selected Â£20 but the pump stopped at Â£19.50 and no more fuel came out if the pump. Also I want to mention is that when I log in to the app with Face ID everything works fine apart from going to the rewards section which is slow is loading. Can this bug be fixed please as this is a bit irritating. Thanks
I registered and now when I sign in it asks for me to set a security question I done that then asks for a 4 digit pin. I do that then confirm it and it tell me I already have an account and signs me out. Well I know I have an account I just clicked sign in. Been like this for a few months thought I would wait for an update but still the same. Disappointed as BP is my local.
The app is great - once it opens. Itâ€™s so slow and frustrating when in a queue wishing to pay and scan the card - for the staff and the customers behind you!
Why canâ€™t you pay by Apple Pay as you can with Shell app.
"Well Iâ€™ve been using the card for rewards only for weeks. 
Only just got round to registering it and linking it to the app which Iâ€™ve just downloaded. 
It shows Iâ€™ve got almost Â£2 to spend on the offers, but states there are currently no offers available ! Great, really worthwhile. 

I didnâ€™t realise you could link a bank card and pay with it in your car. I only got it after verbalising my annoyance at them discontinuing Nectar! My fuel points on my Nectar card pays for my Christmas dinner from Sainsburyâ€™s each year so I was very unimpressed indeed. 
I said Iâ€™d be buying fuel in Tesco and getting Clubcard points for Christmas dinner shopping there instead. After he told me I could use this new card for free fuel I gave in and took one but having read the reviews here Iâ€™m even more unhappy. I am not having Â£100 frozen in my account to fill up which is only Â£60. Iâ€™m not risking being stopped round the corner for non payment, and Iâ€™m not sitting there waiting for my phone to realise which BP Iâ€™m at, as I could of popped in and paid by the time it did that. The only benefit would be not leaving kids in the car but it sounds like it often says â€œerror go in and payâ€ so Iâ€™ll stick to doing that in the first place."
"Used to be a great app but was updated some time ago and I now canâ€™t get past the accepting the terms and conditions page. Every time I tick the boxes and confirm it takes me immediately back to the same page and I have to tick them again. 

Iâ€™ve tried logging out and logging back in and have even uninstalled and reinstalled without luck. 

Now given up! Shame as it was quite a useful app before.

Update: Emailed the app support team and have been comprehensively ignored. Auto response stating I would get a reply in 3-5 days. One month on and absolutely nothing from them at all. 

Terrible app. Terrible service. Iâ€™m going to Esso!

Further Update: BP replied to review stating T&C issue was fixed. Downloaded the app again. Logged back in. Exactly the same problem. Not fixed at all. I canâ€™t believe it can be this hard to fix an app!"
Needs to be able to add rewards card to wallet
Used a few times. Seems to work ok when itâ€™s working. Then... parked up by a pump. App stated thereâ€™s a new update and wouldnâ€™t proceed. App Store connection not possible to do the update. Game over. Wasted 5 minutes. Now Iâ€™m home with lovely WiFi and the App Store says â€œopenâ€ not â€œupdateâ€. Select open and it goes to the app which says â€œupdateâ€. I can delete the app and start again but I canâ€™t be @rsed.
Counterintuitive to have an app when phones are not allowed round the forecourt and then very rarely opens when bar code needs scanning.
"A number of times I try to use this app, it will not connect to the â€˜BPâ€™ server. The icon just spins and spins, running down my battery. The other day I pulled into the BP garage, being one had used previously and again there was no connection. 
Come on folks, if it doesnâ€™t work properly why donâ€™t you try and fix it. An app that doesnâ€™t work is an app thatâ€™s not worth having!"
Even with a 100% reliable internet connection this app consistently fails to load the rewards page, in particular, while regularly logging the user out - prompting the eternal spinning wheel of death. Utter rubbish at the moment; I use the plastic card which, while less informative, is more responsive and portable. Sort it out BP.
"Downloaded this app on the first day the BP Rewards scheme was launched. Registered online as advised... the app wonâ€™t let me log in. Which means it is totally useless. 

Contacted BP support it. Not a sniff of help. 

Dreadful. Will use alternative stations now."
Slowest app out there. If youâ€™ve got no internet connection you are in trouble. No way (seemingly) of checking transactions. A lesson in how not to design an app.
Works about 50% of the time. ..... if youâ€™re lucky.
After taking advice from reviews of all those who have used the app I decided to try as BP is who I purchase fuel with. Not only did they block my card when I tried to do it, but I told the staff inside when I paid in cash and they even said they donâ€™t use it as the app is terrible. Says it all really. Had to phone up my bank and unblock my credit card, which made me late for a 2 hour drive to meet my friend for a bridesmaid fitting. Not happy in the slightest. Itâ€™s not a difficult concept so you guys really need to re-evaluate your product so that it works easily every time. Iâ€™ve deleted it and would be very reluctant to try again. The convenience of paying on an app would be ideal for me as I work 13 hour shifts as a nurse and sometimes you canâ€™t face getting fuel before you land home and chance it the following morning but if shops donâ€™t open til 7am that makes me late for work. I end up going to another provider who have pay at pump
In summary, the app is very buggy. It is very slow, does not connect â€œgets stuck on trying to unlock the pumpâ€ and therefore it is useless.
Have been unable to register via the app for weeks. Enter details but app freezes.
Good overall app but for some reason my bank (Lloyds) sometimes refuses the payment via the app. Please sort this issue out!
A good app and reward scheme to replace Nectar, I wish there was a history / statement of reward collections though to keep a track on where and how itâ€™s totalled. Hopefully soon eh BP me??
Will not scan credit card no help line useless
"Very frustrating I have had this app since the beginning I registered and everything then I picked up a card from the station and use it to add points to it and since then I have still been unable to link my card to my app I donâ€™t understand the problem itâ€™s such a simple process. I have called numerous times and they keep saying it will be sorted soon I asked them to add it to my account manually and they are unable to...? 

How is it possible they have created this app and got all this staff to answer phone calls etc and you phone them to do one simple thing â€œlink my card to my accountâ€ and even this they are unable to do!! Just ridiculous I keep waiting for new app updates thinking Iâ€™ll try it after this update Iâ€™ll try after this update and many updates later STILL IMPOSSIBLE. 

I have been using BP for about 8 years straight full tank sometime twice a week if not every week each full tank Â£60-Â£70 and this service is just rubbish. 

I havenâ€™t even tried the payment through the app option as they canâ€™t even link one card to one account I donâ€™t trust them to take the correct payment just yet. 

This needs sorting ASAP."
The app has not been configured for seamless integration of keychain and FaceTime. The new registration process was horrific and I had to enter it all manually twice and write down passwords. If this is the level of attention BP puts into its â€˜secureâ€™ IT infrastructure that protects my credit card details, Iâ€™ll give it a pass.
Extreme frustration beside the pump has compelled me to write a review. A laborious login process requires you to enter email and password every time; other fuelling apps just require a PIN. Then youâ€™re confronted with a spinning loading circle that spins... forever. The few times Iâ€™ve got past that, the app has crashed. This is all with a new iPhone and up to date app and OS, by the way. You risk drawing the ire of drivers behind you because youâ€™re sitting in your car for so long, apparently doing nothing! Iâ€™ve persisted, because there are two BP stations on my commute, but have now decided to go a little bit out of my way to an Esso station. Their app works!
"This is the worst app on my phone. It takes for ever to log in (regardless of signal strength), the page refresh takes almost as long, rewards take about 3-4 refreshes to appear too. Getting the card up to claim points in store takes ages too. The assistant recommended I screenshot the card so I can get points without using the app. 

I wish I had got a proper card instead of using the app only. And I have fed back using the app feedback bit too - waiting for response..."
Very convenient and helpful, brilliant app.
It doesnâ€™t show where my nearest BP is I have updated this but still doesnâ€™t work! Canâ€™t even select pump??
Just canâ€™t get the app to log in. Account creation is awful so I canâ€™t even say whether the app is good to use. Disappointed.
Absolutely rubbish, couldnâ€™t even get past the register page as email link to set password wouldnâ€™t work. Assuming itâ€™s absolutely bug ridden!!!!!!!
Have been using the BP app for while now. It helps queuing up to pay for your petrol. Great app saves a load of time. Would definitely recommend. The only disappointing feature is using the card feature in the shops, suggest using the wallet feature. Thanks
As above. Cannot register a card. Tried twice now. With two separate cards. Sort it out lads.
This should be a really good app and it is when it works. Sadly, I am finding almost every time I try to use it my bank declines. Now this may be a Lloyds bank issue but I have spoken to them and naturally they the fault is not with them. Either way, there is a recurring problem which is very frustrating.
What a terrible app! Or a terrible design by BP. As another reviewer describes perfectly, the registration system and how you link the Rewards card to the app is codswallop rubbish. Even after the call centre tried to sort out the mess, the app still does not recognize or acknowledge the original reward card on my account. The call centre couldnâ€™t find the details at the BP end, even though the app itself recognized me and addressed me by name. Call centre then organized the link between card and account at their end, but the app still does not recognize the card that should be linked to my account. Iâ€™ve just spent 2 hours fighting with this app, and Iâ€™ve had enough. Will just go and fill my car up in some cheap nameless garage instead. Makes life a lot simpler. Why canâ€™t the Reward card work as simply as Nectar did? Wish there was a no-star option for rating this app.
The app was not easy to set up. More importantly, the reward card does not usually open when I tap it. I have had to tap hard repeatedly to open the card, even after deleting and reloading the app.
Useless
Unable to link my rewards card to my app. I have reset my password numerous time and able unable to login on the website.
Keeps popping up to say to accept t&câ€™s and privacy policy, when selected and continued it just pops up again - in a constant loop! Meaning you canâ€™t use the app at all!!
Terrible app. Been trying for weeks not to put in a payment method but it keeps saying card not Registered. Therefore canâ€™t even use the app. Rubbish. Needs fixing ASAP.
Why make me go through such an arduous sign-up process (name, email, email verification, password, PIN, confirmation code signing into the app)?  Things have moved on in the last ten years.  Why not just let me pay for petrol with Apple Pay / Touch ID?
"Installed the app, registered, signed it and allowed face recognition to log in. Now every time I go to log in Iâ€™m asked for my sign in details again with no facial log in ðŸ¤”
Also, whatâ€™s with having to use location services or you canâ€™t even use the app!! Other fuel apps allow you to use their apps without location services so whyâ€™s my location so important to you BP? Adverts and data collection no doubt!"
I have tried re-registering. I have tried with internet and without. I canâ€™t log in. I canâ€™t use the app. Itâ€™s not actually worth the one star. I am deleting the app.
"I reluctantly agreed to this, having been asked every single time I go to the same garage. 

Got a card, downloaded the app. QR code didnâ€™t work, as it took me to a site that had a failed proxy error. 

Clunky, convoluted, time consuming way to sign up- including two separate emails to verify who I was - for a damned rewards card. Jeez- I am now getting sick of this and I havenâ€™t even started using it yet. 

Eventually the temporary physical card is linked to my app. Yes, the app- because I really need another app on my phone. Like I need an enema. 

So now I have an app, that wants my bank card details, and has no way to find out anywhere ANY value to having this app.

Yes, having gone through the entire process I canâ€™t find anything, nowhere that tells me what I can do with the â€œrewardsâ€

Yes, there is a button to redeem rewards- which pushes you out of the app (so yet again the app has no purpose) and goes to a website - that fails to load. And if I look on a PC on the BP Me website there seems to be no information on how to redeem, or on what. What is the point?

So I now have an app that wants my bank card, and can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me. Why donâ€™t I just sign up a direct debit and you can take money randomly from me?

Someone in BP clearly spent a lot of time trying to work out how to retain customer loyalty, and I get the concept. 

Itâ€™s just this app, and the entire process of setting up, paying, collecting and (hopefully somehow) redeeming, is utterly incompetent and does nothing but annoys me. 

I might genuinely stop using BP because of this app. Is is totally counter-productive to what they are trying to achieve. 

I would be very, very surprised if this entire BP Me fiasco is not overhauled or cancelled in the next 12 months. It is pointless, which is kind of crazy for a points collecting app."
"App seems ok, like others the Â£100 hold seems a bit excessive but other than that fairly painless apart from the looks from other drivers who think you are driving off without paying. 

The big issue, is youâ€™re promised 250 reward points for registering, but these donâ€™t appear and there is no link to contacting any customer service via the app."
App hasnâ€™t been working on my phone now for weeks! Keeps telling me thereâ€™s an error and to pay instore. I thought it was a glitch but itâ€™s been weeks and weeks now. Have deleted it now and will not use BP anymore
When I go to tap on the rewards card in app it wonâ€™t pop up and it works randomly on a irregular basis
Renders it pointless is I cannot add my card to the app to pay for fuel.......
Utterly useless. App constantly showing an error message about having technical issues and suggesting I pay in kiosk. That defeats the object of having an app. Why bother at all?
"App wouldnâ€™t accept my card despite the pre authorisation charges coming through fine. 

Decent idea but cards should be able to be added and pre authorised before actually being at the pump."
Many problems with the app.
I fill up and shop and my local BP all the time! Once I heard about the new system instead of nectar I was thrilled that we can save up point and spend them in the shop on items and fuel! Good for saving money in the long run! Would be nice though if I could change my email as the one I set it up with Iâ€™m planning on deleting. Thank you though!
Why should I share my location with you? App doesnâ€™t work if you donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not as if itâ€™s a navigation app. All I wanted was to collect points without a plastic card, not to tell BP everywhere I go. Have deleted it.
Does not seem to work in terms of paying at pump. Also why no fuel price info at nearby BP pumps?
No petrol prices displayed so whatâ€™s the point. Waze does a better job
Downloaded the App this morning and tried it at my local BP and it works. Really intuitive, no issues.
A pretty decent app, but the process to unlock a pump takes a while. Also, would be good if the rewards card could be added to Apple wallet.
"The service that I have received from BP using their app has been frankly disgusting.

Someone hacked my account and stole my reward points in September, itâ€™s November now and still nothing has happened, despite me reporting it the day that it happened. I have had literally no communication from BP other than standard stalling messages â€œassuringâ€ me that they are doing something. They only told me that because I chased them constantly.

I thank my lucky stars that I hadnâ€™t loaded up my credit card details or anything actually important because BP seem to have zero concept of how important peopleâ€™s personal data is.

Shockingly incompetent management of the issue and communications.

AVOID. AVOID. AVOID!!!!!!!"
"Now the teething problems if stations not having the right software in have been sorted, this works really smoothly. 

Couple of seconds on app, pump opened fuel up and drive off. 

It does feel a bit like you're driving off without paying ðŸ˜³"
I have registered, tried to log in, been sent and entered a verification code and it still wonâ€™t get past the log in screen. It does not say I have failed to log in, it just hangs. Pointless app.
Multiple times Iâ€™ve tried downloading this app and every time I canâ€™t login. It says â€œoopsâ€ and some error.
"Very annoying registration process. Complicate password requirements.
Mandatory to allow location finder."
The app is easy to use and I love not having to go in and join the queue to pay.
This is the worst app Iâ€™ve downloaded. The shell offering is far better.
Very slow to reset password when phone deletes the app off your phone annoyed!!
If the point of the card is to get points make it flipping simple to get to the flipping card! Instead Iâ€™m stood like an idiot trying to get my card to appear for scanning. Also why is this the only points system where you have to scan the arc after paying. Itâ€™s stupid, go into any supermarket and learn how to do this dumb asses. Then come fix this app. As a developer myself this type of lazy design makes me sick.
Itâ€™s not kept updated, doesnâ€™t give prices and mis labels stations that are not BP as BP.
What a load of rubbish. Set up my account online by creating a password and email address. Downloaded the app then clicked the verify password in the email received. A message appears stating I have no Apps to access - incorrect. When I try and log in from the app, it ignores my details and takes me back to the login page. I then tried to register via the app and it says I already have an account. I will no longer bother with BP as they no longer accept Nectar and the hassle of trying to set this up was an absolute pain.
Doesnâ€™t work. Crashes all the time
Iâ€™ve tried to use this app every time I get fuel. I always try to use it to pay for fuel in app, as pay at pump is always more convenient, but using my Lloydâ€™s bank card, itâ€™s been declined all but one time, and for the last transaction I had to add a different card. Additionally more than once Iâ€™ve had to just not scan my card for points at all because the app crashed and signed me out and I no longer carry my physical card. If the transaction being declined can be resolved itâ€™d be a much better app.
Any support for Apple Wallet, app takes too long to load to collect points in store. Apart from that seems to work ok for paying for fuel.
Love the convenience
Great app that speeds up the mundane process of buying fuel. If the developer would add Apple CarPlay support this would be a 5* app for me.
Not working. Each time I try to log in, it keeps saying that this email is already registered. Have deleted and reinstalled and still getting the same problem. This has been happening for months now and seems the app is not really worth the effort. Why couldnâ€™t BP have kept the Necter card instead
Quick and easy what more can I say
This is a good app, please consider allowing reward cards to be added to Apple Wallet, for general ease of use. Thanks.
Really not impressed. It defaults to the station page when you open it - I just want to quickly access the barcode for the card, thanks. It seems to want to hide that barcode, when itâ€™s a key part of it. And having scanned the hard to get to barcode several times after filling up with fuel, it hasnâ€™t registered any of the transactions. So no points accrued, except for the 250 welcome points. So itâ€™s quite literally pointless.  Avoid.
It is easier to pay by card. Donâ€™t see reason use app. Which is not working. Even petrol station personal agree.
After choosing a password four times, resetting it three times because it was apparently wrong, when I finally arrived in the app there was one link to an app launcher for BP Rewards. Clicking it did nothing. That was the only thing the app did and it didnâ€™t do that.
Having a major issues adding payment cards not allowing me to add any cards
"When I try and log in it wonâ€™t let me sign in and I receive the error message â€œsomething went wrongâ€ for some reason I have two reward cards on my app when I only own one reward card , whenever I try and unlike the card it will still show, just went on the website and removed the card but it wonâ€™t let me check this on the app, Iâ€™ll be near a station and it wonâ€™t locate the station , Iâ€™m collecting points but to no use because I canâ€™t even check how many points I have earned, the website also kept logging me out when ever I tried to click on something e.g. my reward cards. 
The overall idea of the app is good if it works, thatâ€™s the problem here it doesnâ€™t work as it should."
Dosent work if i wanna pay by app stuck on load Iâ€™ve tried on different network including wifi no changes
The BPme app has lost my rewards points. I cannot re link my card. I have now lost confidence in the BPme app and wonâ€™t be using it.
Utter utter utter utter utter utter utter utter crap. There are 3 things easier than trying to link a NEW rewards card (from a BP garage) to your EXISTING BPme account: Brain surgery, quantum physics and getting a loan.
Even though the app does what it should it usually says, after fuelling, that thereâ€™s a technical problem and to start again or go to the counter! Itâ€™s bizarre because it actually does work and emails a receipt.  Itâ€™s annoying as it requires an extra check to make sure that youâ€™re not driving off with a payment failure.   Please fix it!!!!!
All I seem to get is an error message every time I try to view my points ðŸ™
"Basically what all the other reviews have said and more.
I donâ€™t like that the app forces me to give location and then tells me there isnâ€™t a BP near me...when there is one a mile down the rd!
Also I have desperately tried to find on the app how to order a new card as I have misplaced mine and there is no info or no process on there to order replacements.
The fact that you would most probably be using this on the forecourts of Petrol Stns is unsafe and you run the risk of having someone shouting at you through a tannoy telling you to put phone away! Lol itâ€™s a joke app from one of the so called biggest petroleum companies in the world."
"Paying via the app consistently gets blocked by both LLOYDS bank and HALIFAX on the grounds of possible fraudulent activity on my cards. 
App just says speak to someone on store, the store says â€œyeah its usual just ask the bank to release your cardâ€ and the bank says canâ€™t tell you why bp are considered a fraud risk but weâ€™ll release your card 10 mins later... every time.
Not worth the agro, something seriously wrong in how the developers have implemented payment on the app for it to be flagged for fraud by TWO separate institutions. Until BP integrate payments properly with apple pay or even paypal... like SHELL, suggest using them instead if you need pay at pump."
Love the idea of this app. But we canâ€™t use it with out BP fuel cards. Would be great if you could make this happen. Thanks :)
Stranded at the petrol station. Again. By an eternal log in loop. DO NOT RELY ON THIS. Please, please sort this out. It is useless. Zero stars if I could.
The app will not even let me login in just go back to home page all the time and I am a business customer not happy
"Why does it ask me a security question? This is ridiculous, I already have a secure password that auto fills using password manager.

Why go and ruin the whole login experience and force me to use an insecure memorable question/answer?

BP should be ashamed of themselves for promoting memorable passwords which are inherently easy to guess or for a perpetrator to socially engineer.

I purposely used an unmemorable security answer which I cannot remember and now cannot login because thereâ€™s no â€œforgot answerâ€ button. App is now useless."
"Having held up other customers trying to get the app to work and register my card, you were going to take Â£100 from me until some time in the future. 

No problem - the app didnâ€™t work and I had to pay the old fashioned way. 

Do all that happened was irate customers including me"
Make sure you use the app before you use the pump because it only pays for the the fuel after paying on the app. Makes no sense.
Why make a rewards app which replaces a physical card, and then not support Apple Wallet?!
In principal it should be good .. but daily There are errors and you cannot see your balance or activate any extra rewards .. if they fix that it will be a decent app
Stop, app on, fuel, go. A 2 minute affair. Whatâ€™s not to love in this rushed world where time is the most expensive commodity?! Love it!
Great but doesnâ€™t always work
Wow. Had the app for a while but not used it. Had to just now as the station was unmanned. So easy to do!
"This is the THIRD time Iâ€™ve tried to use this App. Itâ€™s so confusing to use! I wanted to use it to add points with purchases instead of carrying round a plastic rewards card. When I finally navigated to where to enter my Rewards Card details, it came up with an error message! So frustrating!!
For a company as large as BP you would expect the App to be simpler to use and to actually work!!
Please just re-join the Nectar Card scheme, so much easier to use!
I think Iâ€™ll just stick with the plastic card and ditch the App."
Used without issue for a few months but now canâ€™t login. Tried changing password but still no joy, just a blank sceeen!
"If you have two hours to waste getting the the app to accept the the username & password that it has made you set and change then this app is definitely for you.

Great job BP developers!"
"Poorly designed app that is very buggy unable to put my card details in. 

unable to use without giving your location - uses your data to inform you where the nearest BP garage is which isnâ€™t helpful. 

Essentially less user friendly than the card given to me at the petrol station."
Registerd the account downloaded the app and it simply wonâ€™t work. Trying to log in just sends you back to the log in page every time you enter the username and password. Wast of time.
"Iâ€™ve spent the whole morning trying to add my BPme rewards card. One minute itâ€™s there, the next, itâ€™s gone! Try to re-enter the card details and it tells me something has gone wrong and to try again later. 

As I am yet to use this app to get fuel itâ€™s hardly filling me with confidence that I wonâ€™t be stranded on the forecourt without being able to pay using the app. Add that to other reviews stating that BP earmark Â£100 from your account on a long term basis while your bank clears the funds, I find that rather odd as I canâ€™t fit more than Â£50 in my car at any one time. Why should I give BP the loan of my cash? They wonâ€™t loan me a tank full of for a week!

Until BP sort this useless app out I shall be deleting it and stick with walking across the forecourt and dealing with a human."
Not a good app. Doesnâ€™t come up with recent scans or anything, and app always seems to have issues..
"A few things make this app awkward to use. Firstly that it logs you out automatically meaning you have to log in every time you want it in the shop. Secondly, it regularly freezes, saying â€œoops - something went wrongâ€! Therefore you donâ€™t get accurate updates of your points. Thirdly, it rarely scans in the shop and the poor assistant ends up manually typing in your number. 
The Shell one is far superior - take a leaf BP!"
App wonâ€™t let me link my card to the APP South Africa call centre canâ€™t understand what your on about losing my patience !!! Donâ€™t bother installing this app ! Constantly crashes customer service dreadful !!
Wonâ€™t let me register rewards card in app. Error. Says I should call 0800 number. No one there. Long wait. Too much hassle.
"I cannot pay using the app. I contacted my bank and they have not blocked any transactions from Bp. The app states that I should speak to staff to resolve issue but they donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong and said no one uses it here anyway.  I messaged Bp 3 times and they have not got back to me. To the app developers- do not say sorry to me and ask me to contact someone else at Bp. You should let them know about the issues and get it sorted.

Update: No, Iâ€™m afraid I have not and will not contact the â€˜careâ€™-line team. This is shadow work. It should be enough that I use the app to give feedback and leave this review for Bp to get their act together."
Makes life easy for me
Love it when it works but Lloydâ€™s bank stops every othe BPme transaction on phone app for security reasons. I get a message on my mobile which I have to verify by saying yes itâ€™s me performing transaction.  I then have to wait ten minutes before trying again. I havenâ€™t got time to wait so end up going in to station to pay or drive to a different petroleum station. I have contacted Lloydâ€™s bank but they say there is nothing they can do about it. Itâ€™s some kind of automated online security thing.
Certain petrol stations are very reliable for connections but one or two I would use regularly are more often unable to connect the app. The one on the Knock dual carriageway is never able to connect.
"This app is painfully slow so it does not save time when using to pay for fuel , quicker to go to the till to pay, also there is always an issue of finding my local station . 
Iâ€™ve now deleted the app and will just pay for fuel the old fashioned way. 
Disappointing as always use BP ultimate to fill my car up and would have been nice to get some rewards via the app but itâ€™s to much hassle."
The app is useless as it continually fails to add my card, so deleted the app.
"After using the app many times, Iâ€™m afraid I have now given up with it. A number of times  forecourt staff have said theyâ€™ve scanned it but nothing has been added to my total and nothing is on the receipt. When opening the app most of the time you get a message saying â€œSomething went wrong. Please try again laterâ€. 
Well, too late BPme, Iâ€™m off to use a more reliable rewards scheme."
"Iâ€™ve registered an account and then tired to log on, very unsuccessfully and several of occasions, got fed up and emailed the help centre who at first tried to get different ways to help me, after back and forth over weeks they canâ€™t find out whatâ€™s happening so just stopped answering me!! Customer service is as shocking as the app, which to this day I have still not used.
Iâ€™ve been to the petrol station and collected points but have absolutely no idea what they are for??"
Couldnâ€™t even register as the app kept telling me my old password was invalid!
Tried to register my new BP ME Reward card today, hopeless. Site is slow, hangs and hardly customer friendly.
Dosnt cover Ireland
Please sort the app out. All I get is the loading screen whilst trying to log on. Thanks
Not a user friendly app. It also keeps crashing on my phone. A lot of improvements needed.
Every time you want to review your points message â€œsomething went wrongâ€ comes up. Tried to enter my bank details, no luck with that either. I think it needs a major update to make it work properly. BP â€œstealâ€ some ideas from the competition... Theirs work with no issues!!!!
Ridiculous that you canâ€™t download your reward card with barcode into apple wallet like most other reward cards. This means a number of fumbles clicks before you can pull up the barcode- meanwhile the queues at the till grow in number...
"Every time I try to log in, Iâ€™m asked to verify with a code, then set secret question and then a PIN, only to be told that my email address is â€˜already registeredâ€™.

I know that.  Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m trying to log in and not â€˜registerâ€™ (and yes, I am tapping the correct on-screen â€˜buttonâ€™).

Exasperated."
"There seem to be too many bugs in this system. Iâ€™ve set this up twice now and each time when trying to buy fuel Â£100 is pre authorised on my card. Then there is an error message and I have to just pay in store. The transaction is reversed on my card so money is lost.

Last time I used the reward card part of the app when the cashier scanned the reward card the entire till crashed and had to be rebooted! This resulted in me having to pay for my fuel twice. I now need to try and get a refund on one of the transactions.

This is a good idea, just badly implemented and poorly tested."
"Population boxes not set correctly so the app doesnâ€™t prompt iOS for your email, name or password etc - what are BP paying the developer for!??

Clunky, non intuitive and the data isnâ€™t accurate - sites donâ€™t have the facilities listed-  if BP donâ€™t know whatâ€™s on their site(s) I would be asking serious auditing questions or theyâ€™re not providing accurate data to the developer then this is serious fail."
Why on earth have an app and then the garage hands out bits of paper with offers etc, utterly bizarre
Used this for some time without issue, then all if a sudden my card gets declined twice in succession. However, it works perfectly OK at the till. Donâ€™t know if the problem is with the app itself or with the verification process, but iâ€™m not going to risk having my card blocked.
Whilst most of the time this app works amazingly as it should I recently have nothing but issues every time I try and use the app to save time I end up using more time because all it says is we are having issues unlocking you pump please try again or speak to a member off staff nope staff donâ€™t have a clue I think Iâ€™ll just save my self the hassle and go somewhere I can pay at pump I have two small children donâ€™t have time to get them out car to pay and get them back in to leave crazy
"So many security question (more then for setting up a bank account).

Then after going through this hell, it is not possible to link the card and getting error message"
"This app is pathetic. I may change my opinion if only I could get into it. My password has to be at least 10 digits long and include numbers and uppercase letters. It keeps accepting passwords then on the next screen say they arenâ€™t correct. Emails with links take you to the website and not the app. And of course BP arenâ€™t in when Iâ€™m doing this!

Seriously this is a total waste of time and I havenâ€™t had an issue like this with any other app. Time to sack the app developers and employ a school child. 
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

I eventually managed to log on to this app but then it would not recognise my BP card. I wasnâ€™t told and it doesnâ€™t say to wait 24 hours. So now Iâ€™m up and running but I wonâ€™t be adding my credit card details, Iâ€™ll just the app to record the points I get the few times I use a BP petrol station."
Itâ€™s meant to be easy but not worth the hassle
That is as far as it got !
The sign up process is so utterly laborious, with so many steps that I gave up several months ago, simply couldnâ€™t be bothered with the aggro. I only recently signed up again due to the corona virus situation and the need to pay at pump. Honestly BP, look at how Esso and Shell have implemented registration in their apps and take a leaf out of their book.
"After filling in all my details, verifying my email address via email, then verifying the password I set via a code sent to my email address, then verifying the pin that it asks you to set it took me 15 minutes to get started. That was only the start of the problem. After filling it up said there was a issue so I then went to talk to the cashier. He managed to find the transaction so the payment went through, yet the app then reminded me it hadnâ€™t. I had to force close the app to get rid of the message and in doing so it forgot all my details. Thankfully I got a receipt from the cashier.

Itâ€™s a good idea but really poorly executed. The developers should be embarrassed."
Compared to others this is not fit for purpose. Asks for validation code, emails never received so you canâ€™t use the app. Shell or Esso far superior..
"Successfully used this three times... in fifteen visits and twelve failed attempts. â€œSomething went wrongâ€ as an error message over and over is an exercise in uselessness.
Unless walking to the cashier on crutches is an issue, really (no, REALLY) donâ€™t bother with this app."
"22/March - Sign up was terrible, signup button triggered by registration email didnâ€™t work. The warning shouldâ€™ve have been the link below that said click here if the button doesnâ€™t work.

Will test mobile pay tomorrow (have favourited my local station and setup my debit card). Letâ€™s if theyâ€™ve sorted out locating stations and charging for the right amount."
Tried to use today but would not get past the confirm screen - connection time out. Had to resort to Apple Pay and limit to Â£30 of fuel. Have used for 2 years and found this app to be reliable only 50% of the time so itâ€™s somewhat pointless.
"Havenâ€™t had any issues really in the time Iâ€™ve been using the app.
Itâ€™s great for when youâ€™re on the motorbike too.  Saves issues removing helmet and other gear that get cards out etc..

Only issue Iâ€™ve had is other customers trying to stop me as they think Iâ€™m stealing fuel as I drive off!!"
Internal error message
"Spent 10 minutes trying to set up account, with no joy.  Keeps asking me to change password when logging in.  I give up

I will just have to use shell or Esso instead."
"Does a great job. 

Enhancement request - please integrate Apple sign on and Apple Pay!"
"So I wrote a fairly long example of why this app didnâ€™t seem to bring any benifits, but lots of frustrations in my review around a year ago.

We are now in nearly April 2020 and I am delighted to update on the latest version(s) which seem to have addressed all of the initial bugs or frustrations.

This app now works very well, and is my preferred payment method, although seeing at the Collaboration with the M&S food courts are so good, I often go into the store to buy a few items and pay for the fuel and shopping together. Itâ€™s here that the app has its second usage as it doubles up as a loyalty card and it doesnâ€™t take long for the savings and offers to build it. 

It might have taken a few issues to get it working well, but BP you have nailed it now.

Brilliant. 

Recommend to any of your customers to get."
The app doesnâ€™t allow you to add the barcode to the wallet app in iPhone.
Thanks for the upgrade that has killed the app it's now permanently stuck on the creating account screen
"Not sure about the latest version but just tried to open the app which was working more than a week ago to find that the app wanted me to create an account. 

Then when I tried to log in the screen just says hello what is going on!!"
Can't add payment card. Even after reinstall app. Will use Shell instead. More reliable.
This app has been hit and miss for me.  It worked when I first had the app.  Then it kept telling me my bank declined payment even though I followed the text by saying yes it was me. Today during covid 19 when I really need this to so I could maintain a social distances and avoid not having to go into the shop to pay the app just kept crashing.
Could you add the BPme rewards to the  wallet. Normally I walk with just my phone and end up loosing points because your card is not electronic.
"Iâ€™d seen this advertised on forecourts for a while now but never thought about it until the recent covid issue. I thought it a win win for everyone, keep the station staff safer by not having to go in and hand over cash and me out of the queues inside. It is very easy to use, works flawlessly on my iPhone X and BPs YouTube videos showed me how it worked in practice. I was a little nervous about using it, I didnâ€™t want to fill up and drive away without paying. It is a little alien to just drive off but Iâ€™ll get used to it.  

 For those having issues, be sure to not mess around with the location settings of your phone or itâ€™ll never find the station youâ€™re at. Thanks BP for a smooth app."
"Since the update, I now canâ€™t log on to my account when filling up, so now canâ€™t use the barcode on the app to collect my points. 

The app takes too long to open when it did work, so if you donâ€™t use it to pay, as I donâ€™t as I have a company fuel card, and forget to open the app when I get to the filling station, by the time Iâ€™ve got to the till, it still hasnâ€™t opened to the barcode I need to swipe. 

You need to sort this out as you are going to lose customers with this rubbish app."
Downloaded this app set it all up the night before.  Went to local Bp filling station and tired it out. I double checked with store manager as I felt uncomfortable just driving off after a good chat with store manager this will be my new way of paying.  Top tip set up an email and your receipt will be emailed to you.  The app sets a limit of Â£100 to spend at the pump before you drive off check your app to make sure payment been received.  Well done BP
"Never!! 

Have I ever been so dissatisfied with an App! 

Bp?? Really lost for words?? 

You have put these loyalty cards out there.
There seems no reason for this?? As when you try to register?? And clearly cannot!! 
It then says to contact you???? 

Which I have just tried? 
Via email! 
I have been told this??
Sorry we will look into this!! 
Hope this is helpful to you??
No really not helpful?? 
Thanks for nothing Bp!! 
Just a lot of wasted time!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
I use Chertsey BP station and while the app finds the correct station it will not let me select a pump and says they are unavailable. I was the only one getting fuel this afternoon. Tried this app now for at least two months and fully registered and payment card on it so I do not know what is wrong. Might start to use the Esso one again as this works. Itâ€™s just the BP is more convenient and I donâ€™t do it for the points
Updated it so you canâ€™t login anymore, just created with a slink g wheel after being forced to click register again! Even when it does work (older version) it just opens a mobile browser where you need to login to redeem anyway!
"Itâ€™s not the easiest app to use and itâ€™s almost impossible to get your reward points
Once they fix these issues, this will be a slick app
But for now, a lot more work is needed"
Installed this app so I could pay for fuel at my local BP station to respect social distancing and not come into contact with staff. Filled up my car, tried to use the app and it didnâ€™t work so had to go inside and pay anyway. Absolutely useless, Iâ€™ll delete it.
"Having been registered for BP rewards for a while I downloaded the app in order to pay for petrol without going into pay for it.  Total waste of time because it wonâ€™t log me in, keeps displaying message saying sorry an error has occurred. After the fifth time of trying, and reading the reviews of how this works, have deleted the app and will continue to pay in shop, to a person I can interact with, knowing exactly how much I have spent immediately.
Great idea, but as with many other great virtual ideas, cannot replace actual real people. Great idea poorly executed - must try harder!"
I have missed out on so many points itâ€™s untrue. And I wish the service station staff would make up their minds whether they need the app before or after payment has been made if using it in store! If I Co LoI lad give I zero start I would!
Thought Iâ€™d give the app a try to avoid the covid19 queues. Entire app is buggy and clearly hasnâ€™t been user tested whatsoever. First attempt to pay results in an error and advise to pay in shop. What garbage.
Had Since covid -19 to stop going inside but doesnâ€™t work at all. Even the staff do not know how it works
Waste of time!
Weâ€™ll not install
"The was working fine until I got the update sign saying please update to the newer version of BP app. Tried several times updating the app doesnâ€™t seem to work. 

Itâ€™s a shame that I filled my car with ultimate diesel  fuel in order to earn more points. However, couldnâ€™t open my BP app.

Thanks."
I just put Â£16 of fuel in my car and paid for it with this app.  When I got home I checked my account - Â£100 had been debited, putting me into the red!  The Â£16 payment had not yet been processed.  BPâ€™s website blames the banks and the way they operate with pre-authorisation checks.  This is buck-passing.  Other online shops do pre authorisation checks WITHOUT debiting your account Â£100 so why doesnâ€™t BP?  I will now be out of pocket due to the bank imposing interest on the overdrawn account.  This is a rip off!  I will not be using either the app or BP filling stations again.
"Been using for a while, very helpful.
But annoying atm as canâ€™t open the app as it says needs an update, takes you to AppStore where it just says open. Not update."
App update useless.Will collect Nectar points elsewhere
Why no face recognition for login?
Every time you get to the toll to pay for petrol the app wonâ€™t load, the app needs updating, the app canâ€™t be bothered absolutely hopeless - almost a con to save BP from crediting customers. I would leave zero stars but it wonâ€™t let me. And another thing every single nickname I try to add it wonâ€™t accept Iâ€™m on my 10th try with some of the most obscure names and numbers you could think off and it wonâ€™t let me submit.... may be it only accepts nicknames with 4 stars or more - absolutely hopeless
All I get at the moment is a message to update but that process doesnâ€™t work canâ€™t get any further
"to pay attention to what at least half of the other reviewers have said on here!
Downloaded the latest version of this app yesterday 
Set up account and bank details, and received a welcome message informing me that all was ready to go.
I thought Iâ€™d try it out at my local brand new, super  hi-tech BP/M&S station on the A143 just outside Diss.
Didnâ€™t work!
The app recognised the fuel station via gps, recognised the entered pump number and the â€œfill tankâ€ option only to fail at the â€œunlocking pumpâ€ stage
So, cancelled the attempt and fuelled/payed as normal.
The girl at the checkout said that this was pretty much standard, due apparently to â€œpoor signalâ€ She said that most customers have said the app is more suited to inner city use (?!&Â£)
This despite my phone having a strong 4G signal at that location.
So, back to Shell it is then!

Just hoping that BP support doesnâ€™t try to â€œreach outâ€ to explain what might have gone wrong!"
Very bad app. Can never get money off my shopping or fuel despite having over Â£30 on my card, although thats what the main perk is supposed to be. Seems like they just want you to sign up for Thier marketing benefits! My friends a family wanted to sign up! I stopped them! Nonsense loyalty programme
"Same situation as noted by Verity. Brand new Service station at Diss and have tried and failed twice to pay at the pump. For me no other reason to use the App, especially when there is a queue outside the garage to pay in store.

Useless."
"Utter garbage. Downloaded today as, due to recent events and with vulnerable relatives in family, am now determined to always pay via app from inside car and then do fuelling only to minimise contact. Have recently started doing this with the Shell app which has been totally smooth and trouble free. 
Registered, saw no Apple Pay support so had to add my Revolut card as only had phone on me. Got error saying â€˜your bank has declined the transactionâ€™, which I thought was odd as had never had issues before. Nonetheless assumed it was a Revolut problem, so drove home and added not 1 but 2 other cards, each from a different bank. Came back, and both returned the same error. Between the 3 cards I tried - 3 different providers, some debit some credit, some Visa some MasterCard. So clearly an app issue. (To clarify - there WERE no declined transactions, the message is just a bug).
Uninstalled and will use Shell from now on."
Decent app interface and speedier now for accessing pay at pump. Still missing vital (but simple) features like Apple Pay for payment and Apple Wallet for easier use of BPMe card in-store.
App never works properly for viewing how many points I have saved. Always says thereâ€™s an error and to check later. I think it has worked about 3 times over the many times Iâ€™ve tried to use it. Now itâ€™s not even letting me sign in.
"The app works just fine and I have never had any problems with the full tank option or locating a station as some users have mentioned.
The only flaw however is that the receipt is not emailed as a PDF which makes it very difficult to submit a file to my online expenses app for work."
"always same issues login and canâ€™t use card Iâ€™m not the only. 

Cmon marketing at BP sort this out."
Opened App it says update avail. Go to App Store and no update, just open app, so an endless loop sitting on garage forecourt alongside pump. Well done BP.
"â€œApologies, there appear to be no pumps available right nowâ€

Looks around and itâ€™s an empty forecourt in the late afternoon?

I had this issue when it launched and thought that it was early days, Iâ€™ll wait for them to work out the kinks.

Tried again just now, and look same message. Must be my account as everyone else seems to give it 4-5 stars."
This app is a joke, nobody thought about how it will be used in real life. Forcing you to install updates when youâ€™re sat in your car with a queue of angry motorists behind you is ridiculous!!! Let me use it, Iâ€™ll update later! Also, what currently happens is the app forces me to the App Store page, App Store says there isnâ€™t an update available and now Iâ€™m stuck in an infinite loop. At a time where we need to social distance youâ€™re now forcing me to go in the shop. Massive fail.
"Tried 3 times, as I think it is a great idea. Worked once. Twice couldnâ€™t open pump. Sat there so long got out took petrol normal way. 

Get this working good it will be great!"
"I downloaded this this morning as I did not want to go into our BP filling station for distancing reasons. Pulled up at pump, completed payment card details, got message to start using pump, then ... nothing. Had to reopen car door two or three times to see what the app was saying, finally the man in the filling station waved at me to indicate I should go over to him. App apparently not working today, so I ended up having to go inside to pay after all. Not impressed. The man in the car behind me was remarkably tolerant in the circumstances. 

Just went back to most recent reviews and they seem to be universally negative. How can a major company like BP produce such a rubbish app?"
Terrible set up. Wonâ€™t create an account within the app. Tried going on line on a pc to add my BP card & it thinks itâ€™s a mobile device & wants me to either give my credit card details or redownload the app. Simple answer if I canâ€™t get the app to work is to not go to BP again!
"Having tried many times to log in It is not worth the effort anymore. I contacted BP rewards team and at their request deleted old App re-installed new version and bingo it worked. However, I decided it was time to change my password, received link and duly changed. Tried to log back in same problem as the old App had returned.
I give it one star as I like the colour."
Your app seems to have lots of faults. Itâ€™s so frustrating. Constantly typing in a password and getting error, then changing a password and getting â€œcant use the old oneâ€ WHEN THE OLD ONE NEVER WORKED ANYWAY!!!
Used to be okay but now canâ€™t even log in just says â€˜something went wrong please try again
"Setting this up was great, checking into a pump was fine. But I kept getting a â€˜payment declined by bankâ€™ message so got no further. Tried re-registering bank card, tried another one, same result.

Had to limp home with empty tank, get physical card, fill up and pay inside, using the buttons on the card machine. Asked cashier why app did t work but he had â€˜no ideaâ€™.

So, my hopes of minimising physical contact were dashed. Having also now read horror stories of Â£100 being â€˜reservedâ€™ for up to 10 days, I think Iâ€™ll give up on this.

What a shame. It seemed exactly what we all need right now."
Whenever I fill up I have to log back in or update the app. This time I couldnâ€™t use the app as it needed updating. The update link opened iTunes Store not App Store. The link in the store didnâ€™t update the app but simple took to the BPMe app ... which said it needed updating. Round and round in circles. Even manually searching in the App Store the BPMe app just opened the app rather than letting me update it. After 10 minutes of trying I gave up and searched for the a screenshot of the BP card for the station to scan - Iâ€™ve now saved this for future use instead of wasting time at the pumps and annoying everyone behind me. Since Iâ€™m buying a large tank of premium every time, the points matter. Shellâ€™s app seems much better.
I have never been able to add a credit card. I get a â€œsomething went wrong â€œ message
Hopeless keeps rejecting my password set even though it is 10 digits with numbers and upper and lower case letters.....
This app is utterly useless! It worked fine until the last update but just will not work anymore. I've deleted, reinstalled several times. I've deleted previous card info but now can't re-register my fuel card even with a new activation code!!
The app would be perfect for someone like me but it doesnâ€™t allow you to pay with Amex.. so as far as Iâ€™m concerned, itâ€™s useless until this simple fix is added.
Awful app, never works and means you miss out on points. Go with Shell
The app just wonâ€™t work. It fails to load and exits.  Back to the physical card!
Selected station and pump number, then Â£10 fuel option. Petrol filled up then stopped at Â£9. Couldnâ€™t add any extra to take me to Â£10 which Iâ€™d been charged for. Then went into the shop to query what had happened, they then said I needed to pay for my fuel bill of Â£9!!! Argh!! What is the point of using an app if it charges you for a fuel value the pump wonâ€™t allow you to take and the shop have no visibility of the payment. The shop didnâ€™t even know the app did this!! Iâ€™d like my Â£1 back for the fuel Iâ€™ve been charged for, that I wasnâ€™t allowed to fill up to the full value for.
To begin with it was quite good. The. It stopped working, bank declined the transaction at the garage less than a mile from my home! The garage 55 miles from my home it worked fine! App then stopped working all together then started working again but again bank declined the transaction. In a time (June 2020) when reduced social contact is advised an app that allows contactless payment and fuel fill up would be really useful - if it worked!
"I installed this app in the clearly mistaken belief that it would allow me to pay for fuel.
Having struggled to even sign up, to have fought against password rules, to have had to deduce which three appa I have to use to make password reset work ... I now have an app
for a rewards programme I have no intention of joining, but apparently not a means of paying for fuel.
Nope."
I have collected points on 3 visits at the start of signing up, But that was it, the next 3 times I have lost over Â£170 worth of points as they didnâ€™t load onto my card!!
Over complicated and very very little back in return. Not worth the hassle
Have been using App to keep note of points awards, but chose today to use to pay, you need to read up on the process first but it is vey simple, having linked credit card  (before using) you select petrol station once to arrive (and you can tell App this is your preferred location) and then which pump and after that whether you intend filling up or just a set amount, I chose fill up and as some have criticised it does initially put Â£100 onto your card as pending transaction, but seems only downside, overall very simple to use and saves time plus concerns you might have (during Covid pandemic) of having to go into shop to pay with card
"I always buy fuels for my car from bp for about a year.
I always use bp app for points 
After I got some point worth for  a few pounds ,I start try to use those money from my BPme  app. But it is always decline and I canâ€™t use it, even I can see the amount of my points money on the app. After I tried for 2-3 times. I broke the BP card and threw in to the bin and I will delete this app from my phone after this comment. Why should I keep it for useless app and wasting time to scan when I buy the fuel.
 Not because of a few money , I feel unhappy because I felt I have being cheated."
BP is absolute rubbish. Overpriced fuel without any benefit. When they have kicked out nectar that was the worst decision ever. BP Reward is a joke it started very well but sorry after few months absolutely nothing you will get nothing with this reward system. BP promised it will be great but is great rubbish. Pay over App another joke is declined all the time and there is nothing wrong with my bank I have checked every time when I have used BP station and BP IT is blaming bank ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ another good joke. Well useless APP and Reward system is joke!!! Time to move to Esso back to nectar sorry BP but well disappointed with app and specially with your joke reward system. Bey bey ðŸ‘Ž
I cannot get this to work at all.   Every time I try to log in it says â€œSorry Something Went Wrongâ€.   I guess BP doesnâ€™t want my custom - petrol is always a couple of pence more a litre than Esso or Shell anyway.
Registration was very easy and off I went to fill up. Registered 3 different cards with 2 different banks but none were useable at the BPme Wantage Petrol Station local to me. Phoned the banks who said there should be no problem. Phoned BPme who are investigating why I canâ€™t use the BPme app. Iâ€™m really keen to use the app as Iâ€™m Covid Extremely Vulnerable and Iâ€™m trying to avoid going in any petrol station shops to pay. Waiting to hear the outcome of bpmeâ€™s investigation.
Put my card details in, selected the petrol station then wouldnâ€™t let me select the pump number or pay. Rubbish. Had to go into the shop which I wanted to avoid.
The BP Garage in Clydebank , has the most friendly staff ,they are always willing  to help ,and the forecourt and shop is always clean .
Worked well then logged me out and has never been able to log in again. Just says something is wrong. Tried to set up new password which goes through then says something is wrong. After a while I have discovered what is wrong.... me wasting my time with this stupid app, so I deleted it and focused on filling up at shell... something is now right for me at least.
I have used this app twice. The first time worked perfectly with the app recording the payment and an email sent recording the payment. The second time I used it, it all worked right up to the point when I confirmed the payment, when the app announced there had been an error and suggested I try again. This I did with the same result. On checking my credit card account I now see 2 pending transactions of Â£100 each! Clearly if the app failed it should have deleted the pending amounts.
Hi my app keeps logging out.
When it worked, filling the petrol tank was a smooth transaction. A smug smile would cross my lips as I slid back into the drivers seat, watching the others traipse to the payment till in the driving rain.  Then my bankâ€™s (Lloydâ€™s) online security gets upgraded and the app stops working. I the transaction fails and I get a â€œwas this you?â€ Text from the bank, which tells me to try again 10 minutes later. Now I am a rain sodden, un-smugged punter, who now fills up at the cheapest (none BP) petrol station.
"Due to pandemic I thought itâ€™d be safer to pay for fuel without going inside shop. Tried it in two stations today and it failed in both stations. 

First station I tried it displayed (no pumps available) although Iâ€™m parked next to one. So I called the station and they said they are aware of the fault but they havenâ€™t reported it yet ! 

So I drove of to a second station I googled a few miles away, waited nearly 5mins for the app to unlock the pump and by the time I was done refuelling it displayed an error message saying something went wrong please pay inside the station! So I called the station while parked outside and requested to pay for the fuel by phone because the app failed, I was told I canâ€™t do that and I need to come in to pay! I said if I wanted to come in why would I be using the app ?

In the end, I had to walk in and pay so donâ€™t bother"
The old BP app used to have a feature whereby you could identify BP stations with an M&S food outlet â€“ that was really useful, and it seems it is no longer available. Please restore this as soon as possible!
Unfortunately never works, for the moment I just use to scan the loyalty card and hoping that someone someday will fix this nice app.
Iâ€™ve tried to use this app probably 10 times and itâ€™s not worked on half of them. â€œWe are experiencing technical issues please go in and payâ€ often the issue, also has randomly lost card details. Not worth the hassle at all.
Used to work. They updated it and you end up in a loop trying to log in and then it says youâ€™re not near a station. Donâ€™t bother itâ€™s quicker to go in and pay.
"Used to work fine. Now never able to use it. Either it thinks I have no payment method stored, or it canâ€™t a station (even if youâ€™re on the forecourt) or it just wonâ€™t unlock the pump.
I used to think this app was brilliant, the perfect way to not worry about getting little children out and across busy forecourts. Now itâ€™s an unreliable piece of junk clogging up my phoneâ€™s memory.
Please fix it BP."
"As many others have said, this app simply doesnâ€™t work the majority of the time. Every part of the registration process either fails or times-out the first several times you try it, likewise when you attempt to add a payment method.
The Shell and Esso apps work flawlessly, seem much better designed and even support Apple Pay.
May try again in a few months, but until then Iâ€™ll be purchasing my petrol from the two companies with functional payment apps."
Takes ages to login, then you randomly get kicked out or told you have no payment cards setup etc.
Initially really great app and I thought the obvious way to pay during social distancing but no. App wouldnâ€™t load today then didnâ€™t recognise login. Had to give up and pay in store while I was queuing I got app to open but it could r find the station - I couldnâ€™t collect reward points as app frozen on blank screen by time I reached till. Iâ€™ve just spent an hour at home relaunching the app but it continually freezes. Not worth the agro - will look for an alternative.
Tried to use this app but it was woefully slow to locate the petrol station (iPhone 8, strong 4G signal) and then wouldnâ€™t accept my debit card details. Deleted
Used to work fine but now constantly asking me to log in and always says there is no petrol station nearby when I am actually at the pump forcing me to pick it from a list. Same problem with my wifeâ€™s phone even after reinstalling. Just not worth the effort anymore.
"This app is frustratingly difficult to use. 

Itâ€™ll log me out seemingly at random, while Iâ€™m using the app. 
Itâ€™ll regularly crash and refuse to load the selected page, becoming unresponsive. 
It wonâ€™t even let me add my card as a payment method, crashes on the end screen every single time...

Because of these issues I canâ€™t even register my card for BPme rewards, negating the entire point of this app. 
Waste of time."
Have downloaded the app. Had a nightmare trying to login (attempted about 7 times and have up). Tried again a day later and it logged me in automatically but canâ€™t register me for any BP rewards. Then logged me out on my next attempt and is now static standing on a blank white loading page. Really disappointing as I am a regular BP customer.
App keeps saying â€œerror try again laterâ€ when I try and put payment details on! Went to use at a BP petrol station and despite connecting to their free Wi-fi the app told me I wasnâ€™t connected to the internet! Not great!!
Has worked properly about once but most of the time either says they can't identify a pump, that I have no registered payment card or the payment card has mysteriously disappeared from the app. A company with annual profits of $10 billion+ should probably do a lot better than this. Especially as the the equivalent Shell app has worked flawlessly. Also why no Apple Pay integration?
"Will not recognise fuel stations
When it does there is a significant delay in unlocking pump and authorising payment 
Messages will appear to say there have been payment problems even if payment has gone through
Is not robust enough to rely on
Is not quick enough to be considered as easier than the traditional method of filling up and going inside to pay."
"Seems like Iâ€™m just another of the countless numbers before me that find this app totally useless and unusable.

Struggled my way through creating an account due to the app glitching. 

Now, even after creating an account for the app, it wonâ€™t let me join the BPme rewards scheme despite receiving an email advising that Iâ€™ve successfully registered!

App is a total waste of time, so looks like Iâ€™ll be driving to my closest SHELL garage to fill up, as their app works really well!"
The app was brilliant to begin with and worked well, now is riddled with faults. Logs out all the time, crashes, doesnâ€™t remember your payment methods or canâ€™t find the station youâ€™re sitting in. Hopefully can be fixed
App frequently requires fresh login with email and password, which is hardly great when youâ€™re in a kiosk waiting to pay. Why not use fingerprint? Today I was in a BP station and the app said there was no BP location near me. Finally, the garage canâ€™t scan the bar code on the app. Totally useless.
So every time I use this app it requires me to log in by entering my username an password which is incredibly annoying. Why doesnâ€™t the app remember me or use face recognition??  The last 5 times Iâ€™ve used it the app didnâ€™t work, even when connected to the BP free WiFi, so throughout the last few weeks when weâ€™re supposed to be social distancing Iâ€™ve had to pay at the till every time Iâ€™ve used this app at BP.  I now always fill up at Shell as their app works seamlessly.
I thought this would be a great app to get whilst getting fuel with the baby in the car saves us having to get out etc. It never works so end up going into pay like I used to. Asked the worker in there and she said it never seems to work. I will be using another petrol station with a pay at pump facility in the future.
Using app to get fuel but when I try to join rewards it says my account is blocked and to ring support, support was as much use as a chocolate fire guard!
Would be nice to see support for pre-setting the Â£ amount in advance of going to the station and for the BP rewards card to be added to Apple Wallet (as the Shell App does.. ;-))
"Couldnâ€™t register on line - Blocked me before I even joined! 3 phone calls to Customer Service; â€œ sorry system downâ€ â€œbest grab a physical card, we have troubles with appâ€ inexperienced non-english as a first language didnâ€™t have a clue. Finally â€œsystems down!â€
SHELL was dead easy, this is painful!"
Every single time with the last 2 months (6 times) Iâ€™ve tried to pay using this app and it keep getting declined! EVERY TIME! Prior to May 2020 I never had any problems and my bank has confirmed there is no block on my account! Itâ€™s so infuriating
"The App has not work in several months, the fuel stations managers recognise this too
This should be deleted from the App Store"
Iâ€™d say 50% of the time this app doesnâ€™t connect. The lady serving at the BP near me said much the same thing when I had to go inside to pay. Now thereâ€™s an update that doesnâ€™t update! I am assuming BP have asked their staff to review the app hence the higher than average reviews.
Fantastic APP. Helps safety as well
I can't understand why this app gets such good reviews, 4 times I have tried to use this at a station, pre loaded the app with userid and password with payment details, it either doesnt remember my login or when it does forget my payment details, operationally flawed adding them then takes an eternity to login by which time you have a queue behind you of screaming bad tempered customers. Also it's too slow, so by encouraging the use it is lowering the operational throughout of the station through delaying the throughput.
Just downloaded the app after receiving an email from BP telling me to do so. However, every time I log in it asks me to accept the privacy and t&câ€™s updates (which I do), it takes me to the homepage and then instantly back to the page that asks me to accept the updates. Itâ€™s a loop that means I canâ€™t actually use the app.
Canâ€™t currently open the app. When I open it on my iPhone  I am directed in the opening screen to download an update (with no option not to/proceed to the app). Then Iâ€™m taken to the AppStore, where there is no update available. So what you have here is an opening screen and an inescapable Koop of bugs. Sort it out eh?
...could be better! The first time I tried to use it, the app froze. The second time, I realised it didnâ€™t support Apple Pay and I didnâ€™t have my physical card on me. Both times I had to go in to pay for my fuel which is exactly what I was trying to avoid! The freezing issue seems to have been fixed with an update and I have registered my card now but support for Apple Pay would be a welcome addition!
I now never go to another petrol station now. I love that itâ€™s all contact less and risk free!
"This is easily the worst app that I have ever used. 
Concept is great but terrible in practice. 
I have lost track of how many times my bank have frozen my account thinking the app was fraudulent. 
Bank blames BP, BP blames the bank. 
The BP in store staff simply shrug their shoulders and claim they donâ€™t have a clue.
So frustrating. 
Problems only began when the app was updated whenever it switched from Nectar points to BPMe points. 
Final straw is that I now canâ€™t even add any card to my account."
"Every time I need to just drive up to a station and refuel - this useless App either has logged out, lost my payment card or throws the error â€œsomething is wrong, please pay in storeâ€!

Supposed to be convenient right? Well all the other people paying the normal way have paid and long gone while Iâ€™m constantly sitting here like a muppet trying to get this useless app to work!!!"
Very convenient, saves time sometimes though, the app loses your card details and you have to start all over again, but not too often, great app I love it,more stations need to be involved.
A great app which not only saves me time but is COVID friendly.
Used yesterday for the first as filled up before lock down and have only just needed more fuel. Thought I'd give this app a go so didn't have to go near anyone and it worked flawlessly. Will definitely use again.
Decided to switch to BP as all my local Shell garages have shut (almost) and have a BP one 100yrds from my place of work but the app has only worked 3 times out of 7 or 8 fill ups! Twice it required an update (that wouldnâ€™t work until my phone was home and on WiFi ( even though I have 10gig left) and the other times the card would not open only allowing â€œpay at pumpâ€ and location services. So out of a possible Â£500 of fuel bought Iâ€™ve only got points for around Â£150! Very frustrating
"Great idea but app doesnâ€™t work.

Sat in car trying to get it to work and didnâ€™t want to go into garage as shielding.

Told to try in 10 mins, still didnâ€™t work.

Managed to use it once - brilliant idea shame no longer operational"
When it works itâ€™s great, sadly the last few months it works on rare occasions, hasnâ€™t worked for me for over a week now, deleted it, reinstalled it, rebooted the phone still getting the â€œwe are having technical issuesâ€
"By the time Iâ€™d finished the long winded set up including some multiple emailed verification codes the app blocked my, nil balance, rewards account (to protect me apparently). It did not seem to like that I didnâ€™t already have a loyalty card. Only plus side was it made me try The Shell App which was easy to install and that uses Apple Pay.

Have now called BP to sort out the blocked account. Spoke to someone who said I needed the â€˜specialist App teamâ€™ but having waited ages on hold for them they have just cut me off before getting round to answering. Might be able to use the pay service without the rewards ever being unblocked but unless I have no other choice Iâ€™ll be using a competitor."
"My personal option waiting two months for a query transaction on my card which is temporarily blocked due to fraud ??? ( garage took point assumably in error ) 
This has pointed
Me in the direction of another loyalty scheme at different garage least I actually
Get my club card points for my loyalty"
I like this app. Any chance of a CarPlay App to go with it?
In the days of covid, I decided that paying for fuel via an app would be beneficial. Registered all my details... pump registered... select amount (fortunately I had the sense to adjust â€˜full tankâ€™ to Â£50!!!)... payment authorised... then â€˜sorry, something went wrong, please try againâ€™ so I do try again. Same message. At this point, I decided it wasnâ€™t worth the trouble so fortunately didnâ€™t try again. I fill up and go into the filling station and pay. Three days later and 2 x Â£50 has been taken from my bank account plus the amount I paid in the station. Iâ€™ve contacted BP and received no reply so having to go through the banks to claim the money back. Please donâ€™t use this app - it really shouldnâ€™t be allowed on the market.
Downloaded and registered to ensure contactless filling, but once I arrived at the station (Silvertown) it had â€œtechnical issuesâ€ and wouldnâ€™t work, so ended up having to go into the shop anyway. Would have used a different brand station if Iâ€™d known that the app didnâ€™t work.
Exceptionally unreliable. My last four attempts at using (at three different locations) have resulted in funds being blocked on my card but the transaction cancelling.
"This app is seriously not reliable. The majority of times Iâ€™ve tried to use it have been unsuccessful. It either doesnâ€™t recognise my payment card details, canâ€™t locate BP forecourts or it simply hangs or freezes. 
DO NOT rely on this as a sole means of paying for fuel...you could be stranded. Thatâ€™s actually dangerous!"
Add to manually upload points via phone camera, using till receipt bar code. Had a few occasions when my points have not been added whilst paying in store.
Got the app so I could get the BP card in my Apple wallet but the app isnâ€™t coming up as supported in my wallet. Absolutely no point in keeping the app for me, may as well just photo the card instead
Dreadful App.   BP SHOULD BE ASHAMED
Very hit and miss with my TSB bank account works very occasionally but have now given up
Using iOS the app wonâ€™t let me log in to use my car at the till when paying for fuel, my partner uses my card and I use the app, if I log in using Safari it works fine but app wonâ€™t work
I have had this app for a while, I have yet to use it successfully despite trying at every BP station I have visited, it always says â€œ we are experiencing technical issues pay in shopâ€ I have an iPhone 11, in these times I would rather pay from my car but this app is pointless.
just fuelled using the app, ended going in the store to confirm payment
Am sick of driving specially to a bp garage for fuel only to find this wonâ€™t work/ having technical issues.  Pathetic BP - can do better !
Anything other than full strength signal and the app wonâ€™t load any data, including your barcode which means youâ€™re either having to leave the building to try and get signal or just accepting that you wonâ€™t be able to scan the card. Having the option to add the barcode to wallet would be a massive help and benefit.
Iâ€™m trying to make a payment via the app yet it doesnâ€™t allow me to do so. This has been happening for a while now. Please sort this out ASAP. Thank you
Does not always work, Esso App much better!
The year is 2020, Apple Pay integration should be there out of the gate!  What a pointless app!  Shell know what they are doing BP not so!
Poor signal in some areas means the app wonâ€™t load up or sign-in in time for when youâ€™re at the till. If the rewards card was available in Apple wallet then this would solve the issue of not needing to even open it. Other fuel stations have done it....so you need to too. Thanks.
For 3 weeks Iâ€™ve been contacting support as Iâ€™m unable to add a payment card to my app/account. The major feature of this app is to pay at pump and it simply doesnâ€™t work for me and no one in support at BP seems to want to help.
"Youâ€™d think at this present state of affairs that BP would have this app sorted by now. 
Constant declined transactions have forced me to go into a shop enclosed space which I do not want to enter At
Present. 
Using a different company from now on Esso have an app that actually works!

Update: 10/9/20
No update as nothingâ€™s changed. Totally useless and unhelpful. Had customer services look at my issue twice and donâ€™t seem to have any idea or clue of why. 
Brand leader in fuel. 
Last in app technology."
This app seems to send me to an endless hold loop of accepting terms and conditions.
Downloaded this app as it sounded good, pulled up at my local BP station and all it says is that Iâ€™m not near a BP station!!! So I deleted it and reinstalled it and stood next to the Petrol pump and you guessed it it said I wasnâ€™t near a BP station???? It doesnâ€™t help to keep people safe and not have to go into the shop to pay, it does the opposite and you have to go in as the only reason youâ€™re there is because you need to fill up!!! VERY frustrating!!!
App is great. Works perfectly. As a result, I havenâ€™t needed to mask up and go inside to pay for fuel since COVID started.
When trying to reset password I have been stuck in a loop- when you send me the auth code to my email after password reset I cannot get back to the screen to enter the code. Tried three times, canâ€™t do it, deleting app now.
This worked once, when I installed it. Ever since then it is unable to either locate the station or the pump number. Total waste of time.
so easy
I have digitalised my loyalty cards recently which required me to download a lots of apps. Comparing this to the others, it was straight forward, everything has worked at first, It is easy to use, fuel card can be attached too and also loyalty cards can be added easily.
Every time I try to use this app it tells me it has â€œtechnical issuesâ€ and I have to go into the shop to pay which given the COVID situation is something I try to avoid. Struggle to see the point in the app if it doesnâ€™t work.
App didnâ€™t not work and also caused my bank card to be blocked for suspicious activity when trying to use this app
Unfortunately this app is useless without internet connection. I forgot my physical reward card which I wanted to scan for points so I wanted to try this digital version in the app but because was very bad mobile connection I couldn't get access to it and only wasted my time and also I upset people waiting in the queue behind me...
"The functionality of the app has improved greatly (when I first started using it, more often than not it didnâ€™t work at the pump and I ended up having to go into the station to pay.... defeating the object) but still no Apple Pay option, and still the insistence on placing a reserve of Â£100 on my card if I want to fill the tank? All your competitorsâ€™ apps (Shell, Esso, etc.) donâ€™t do this; they charge for exactly the amount pumped, and they offer Apple Pay as a payment option.
Please get with the programme, BP."
The app has been great but it seems to have stopped working when you try and select pump number????
We are in a pandemic the app always has technical issues so I have to queue up and pay.
Very straightforward to use and in these troubled times means one less contact I have to make. Well done BP for an App that does exactly what it says. Thanks.
"Have tried many times to update my card which expires at the end of the month with its replacement. Iâ€™ve tried at home on Wi-Fi and on mobile broadband. It always says thereâ€™s an error and will not update. 

Please fix this before the end of October."
I need to change my e-mail address. But it seams you canâ€™t change it. Even if you move house for instance and change internet accounts. So I have to start a new card. Very convenient with everything else I have to change or sort out.
You canâ€™t just pump your fuel and then pay with the app. You have to pre-register, then use the app to â€˜unlockâ€™ the pump before you pump the fuel. Total user unfriendly rubbish.
Always use same bp staff are absolutely brilliant helpful cheerful hard working always have a smile and chat. Had great selection although wished theyâ€™d re introduce garlic coriander prawns ðŸ¤— well done BP sixfrields Northampton
Tried to use at the BP in Lenham, Kent to avoid getting stuck behind lots of people doing their weekly shop and it just doesn't work. BP are not the only oil company who just can't seem to get the pay apps right. Just fit a card reader on the pump!
No option to add card to the Apple Wallet App
When the system works it is really handy but in the past week it didnâ€™t work properly. It asked me to retry which I did three times. I now have Â£400 of pending transactions since last Friday (now Tuesday) and it hasnâ€™t cleared from my account. It is deducted from available balance which is a complete pain
"No Apple Pay support, unlike competitors. 

Has a built-in app feedback system that ignores iOSâ€™s â€œdo not pester me about reviewsâ€ setting and interrupted me with an annoying popup message. Thatâ€™s an instant 1-star review as far as Iâ€™m concerned. Iâ€™m surprised the App Store allows it."
"Used this app successfully for months, then one day it stopped working, just when itâ€™s really needed with COVID-19. 
I reported it to BPme who replied to say the problem was fixed. It wasnâ€™t!
Perhaps itâ€™s the local service station thatâ€™s disabled the function, or BP doesnâ€™t pay itâ€™s stations in a timely manner... however the app doesnâ€™t work for me at my local BP. 
 BPme App 1-9783148828"
Itâ€™s completely hit or miss if it works or not. I use it to keep track of work travel expenses but twice this week alone I havenâ€™t been able to use it to pay.
Nice concept when it works. Second time I get double charged. One from the company that operates the app and one from the BP station.
Why does everyone want their own app when could just use a simple well established payment method? This app is long winded to set up and doesn't warn you that you need to set it up in advanced of pumping the petrol. Frustrating and aggravating to the point I may never visit a BP again. Seriously, do better.
Excellent app and easy to use. No more in queue for paying fuel
Super
No response from customer support, no answer to phone and no reply to message query ...... will delete app I think
This app has improved since the last incarnation. Iâ€™d love to be able to add my rewards card to the Apple Wallet which I canâ€™t seem to do
My local petrol station is BP so I would be mad not to collect points. However the app is hopeless. I get emails of offers and go to log in and it doesnâ€™t ever recognise my password. So I go through all the reset and it says we have sent a code. Well nothing ever turns up so I have to ask in the shop whatâ€™s on the card. Aggghhhh but BPâ€™s IT departments have always been rubbish from my experience.
To be fair, the app does seem to be getting more stable/reliable with each passing month but the odd day when it wonâ€™t work can be really annoying (only two months ago I would have only given three stars, so on this trajectory it could be heading for five). On days that it works it is fantastic - quick, easy, efficient.
Not getting my reward points showing after each time I scan the reward card
What a nice slick and trendy service! Love the app! Well done BPðŸ‘
A great service very helpful and easy to use.
Twice missed the points as cashier decided not to swap it and thereâ€™s no way to tell if you got the points or not straight away. And hardly any customer service these days impossible to contact anyone
If you are filling up in an area where two service stations are in the same proximity you can be charged at the wrong location,  and be asked to pay manually at the correct outlet.
Unlike other reward scheme apps I am unable to store my card details in Apple wallet
Please add functionality to add the BP Me rewards card to Apple Wallet!
Already loves for the pay for fuel feature, but itâ€™s going from strength to strength with the recent design changes and new features! Keep up the good work!
Donâ€™t bother with this App. Stations advertise it and arenâ€™t actually set up to use it: the App fails regularly. Ranging from failing to unlock pumps to deleting payment details, to not using Location Services correctly. A solution to Covid-19 so you donâ€™t have to go into the store to pay? Rubbish!!! Had to go into one twice today because this useless App doesnâ€™t do what it is supposed to do. Go and buy your petrol from Shell or anyone else other than BP. A joke considering the size of company and money they make. Whatâ€™s worse is BPâ€™s prices are higher than anyone else - wouldnâ€™t mind if the app and purported convenience actually worked and was delivered on. Rubbish. Rubbish. Rubbish. Guess we shouldnâ€™t be surprised from a company that poured oil all over the Gulf of Mexico.
Doesnâ€™t work with my Lloyds card. Every time Iâ€™ve tried to use this it declines my payment and raises a fraud alert with my bank. I have tried 5 times and have had to sit on the phone for ages trying to unlock my card - 5 times. The bank say itâ€™s not them, itâ€™s  the app. This is the only transaction that has ever raised any issues with the bank so Iâ€™m inclined to believe the bank. I thought this would be great in these COVID times but honestly, there is no point in having it. It just doesnâ€™t work.
The app is handy to have especially when wanting  to save time but if the app had Apple Pay has a option it would be much easier and when trying to select the amount of fuel you want to pay for the bank then intervenes and stops the payment
"Really like the app and itâ€™s concept in giving back something to loyal customers.

Suggestion: have a tab for recent transactions so you can see how many points youâ€™ve earned each time & be able to redeem points/cash value via the app."
"their has been 5 updates and yet the past purchases section still does not display the dates when you have purchased petrol?? 

terrible!!"
I cannot use the app sadly as the app immediately closes every time I attempt to add a payment method. I'm running the latest iOS 14 on an iPhone SE 2020. Please fix asap
"How many times do I have to accept the terms? Is 20 times enough?

No. 

It loops and loops and I wonâ€™t be using BP stations until this is fixed. 

Testing. Testing. Testing."
Used it 6 times. Worked brilliantly 3 times saving me having to touch anything other than the pump. The other times you end up in the shop handing your phone over to the cashier to collect your points. Hardly the COVID experience I was aiming for. Now Iâ€™m just stuck in an useless â€œAccept New Licence Agreementâ€ loop unable to do anything.
Accept new terms and privacy. Tick and tick. Accept new terms and privacy. Tick and tick. Accept new terms and privacy. Tick and tick. Come on get it sorted. Cheers ðŸ‘
After update it keeps asking to confirm terms and conditions on and on and itâ€™ll not let me login
Stuck on accept new terms and conditions screen after last update. Maybe you should get yourself some QAs
Been using the app with absolutely no issues. Brilliant during the pandemic, but now the t&cs have changed and the app needs an update it wonâ€™t update after I accept the changes, so got stuck and had no choice but to go in and pay, defeating the object of trying to avoid people
"This is unusable on my iPad, or iPhone. I logged in. It told me I needed to accept the terms and conditions, not once, not three times, not five times, but 20 times. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app.

I then went through their Iâ€™d verification app a second time (hard to credit, as Iâ€™d just signed in on this device), and am up to my 35th attempt to accept the terms and conditions (i.e. 50+ times total) and Iâ€™m still unable to get in.

Thinking it might be an issue with my iPad, I tried it again with my iPhone. Guess what. The exact same issue. Iâ€™m up to 100 failed logins across 2 devices. This is the definition of unusable.

Classy, BP, classy."
Loved the app... but today itâ€™s broke... on login it now requires me to accept new t&c and privacy statements.. when I check the boxes  and hit accept.. it refreshes the screen and goes back to the same page again ig Irving my acceptance ... constant circle !  Cannot use BP petrol until fixed ...please advise ASAP
Easy to set up and use at the pump. I donâ€™t always want to go in the shop so itâ€™s great for keeping your distance in these difficult times.
The new BP reward scheme is effective, clear and valuable. So much better than many other reward schemes
Wonâ€™t open, wonâ€™t refresh, wonâ€™t update, wonâ€™t except my password...
Tried to use this app 3 times, never worked and each time had to contact my bank to get them to unfreeze my card.
Used this app for ages to pay for fuel, then last couple of months itâ€™s unusable. Despite never logging out, would get to the station forecourt and get asked to log in - wouldnâ€™t let me, just got a blank screen. This happened multiple times. Then tried to log in at home before attempting again and after an update I ticked the permission boxes multiple times and could not go any further forward! Itâ€™s so frustrating as it used to work perfectly fine. Please sort it out!
Easy to navigate round and easy to work, only thing is that it could be compatible for apple wallet so the rewards card is there already rather than always having to go into the app every time to get it up.
Please link the rewards card to Apple Wallet. The days of carrying a card are over. Digging into the app is nowhere near as convenient.
"When this works, itâ€™s great......but at least 50% of the time, it leaves you sitting in the car while you look at the â€˜please wait, weâ€™re unlocking your pumpâ€™ message. Followed by the, â€˜sorry this is taking longer than usualâ€™. 

So you then close the app and try again, but are faced with the same problem. Now, youâ€™ve wasted what feels like 5 minutes waiting for the pump to be unlocked in a busy petrol station. 

In current covid times, the ability to pay from the app is more important than ever. Coupled with having 2 young kids and not wanting to take them out of the car on a miserable winter evening to go in and pay, this app is infuriating when it doesnâ€™t work. 

Iâ€™ve driven off without fuelling up on multiple occasions now feeling frustrated at the poor user experience this app delivers."
Every time I try to add my card details the app crashes, so even if I wanted to use the app at a station I canâ€™t.
Makes it so much easier to fill the car up with no need to queue to pay. Great facility and especially if have children in the car ....
Failed to unlock pump
Staff are great & helpful
Excellent, non contact quality refuelling except for gloved hand really good idea during Covid times.
"I have 2 cards registered and both were declined yesterday and again today - WHY? Iâ€™m not impressed with the app at all!

Martin Croly"
Installed app logged in then changed password logged out then would let me login again saying something like cookies had to be enabled strange thing for a app to say so not impressed
Love this app. Makes it so easy to pay for fuel and means i donâ€™t have to go into the shop. itâ€™s easy to use but of course is dependant on mobile phone signal but thus far that hasnâ€™t been an issue.
Love the app, especially now that it works on all the BPâ€™s around me! I can easily pay through the app so I donâ€™t have to go inside the shop, wait in line or nothing! Just brilliant!
Iâ€™ve been trying to set up the app for sometime. The app keeps telling me to set a password on email - but this keeps looping - itâ€™s infuriating! Not a great experience at all
Amazing
Fantastic, I love ðŸ’•ðŸ’•BP points bonus system.... ... saving money ðŸ’µ...
Much better than the Esso App that keeps logging me out every time Iâ€™m sat at the filling station I have to mess around with reset password. Now I just use BP only..
The reward system for BP is very good and used the points against my Christmas shop in M&S and it saved us a fortune. Very pleased.
Most things you need in BP garages
You couldnâ€™t rely on the app to pay for fuel, half the time it fails to work.
Easy to use.
Could do with having the option of being paying via Apple Pay.
Fairly standard fuel app, works fine and easy to set up, except unlike the Shell app, this one doesnâ€™t give the Apple Pay option.
"This is the Best and easiest way to pay and collect your Bp me points 
Which you can use to pay for food,
This is Not Just Food, this is 
â€œM&S yummy food, snack for you and families 
Wow ðŸ˜²
Bp me App , M&S Food 
Awesome ðŸ˜Ž"
"When it works itâ€™s ok. The support team at BP are non existent. I have messaged numerous times, called left messages - nothing.

App will not take credit card, canâ€™t change email address via the app.

Reasonable app let down by BP."
I try to register , But itâ€™s saying that I canâ€™t use an old password , fix this error please
"This collecting system by BP is so simple , you can see the â€œreal money â€œ you have available, easy collecting and spending 
Thank you 
David"
Easy to sign up and start collecting points. A very versatile and easy to use app.
Always seems to have technical issues didnâ€™t have my card on me already filled with fuel and the app just would not work not the first time which caused a big scene for the sake of a stupid app not working, would give 0 stars if I could. Very temperamental is there a point in this app
Itâ€™s quick to accumulate points for Amazon vouchers.
When it works its fine, but it isn't the most reliable app, and the BPMe website is worse. Received an email today offering bonus points. I click the link in the email and am taken to the BP website. Login, check email for authorisation code (Safari browser never 'remembers' the setting checkbox not to ask again) enter code, website tries to process but am taken back to login screen without having logged in. Tried again, same result. Tried the BPMe app, constantly fails to process and hangs the app. Sorry, just too much hassle.
You get an email telling of your offers so you try to log in, you a an annoying verification code entry section which you enter once an email has been sent to you with it, it then asks to log in again and itâ€™s just Groundhog Day from then on.... Tried to log on the app on my phone and that doesnâ€™t work either!
"I attempted to use the app at the weekend but couldnâ€™t because pumps 7 and 8 for my petrol station were not available on app. 
Emailed you and replied back asking for bank details never got that far couldnâ€™t use app to fuel up. Once again bog standard reply not suitable for my question or fault on the app."
"Why do l keep getting warnings that your emails are dangerous?

Always found BP stations well stocked and very friendly staff and the app just makes it easier to pay for your fuel and giving a bit back to the paying customer is a brilliant gesture.. keep up the good work BP.
Saving money on fuel bike is more important today due to loss of work, income caused by COVID 19 so this is a great hell to reduce fuel bills
"At busy times, a million times quicker as most of the BPâ€™s I use are MandS stores, so thereâ€™s always someone in front of me in the queue to pay doing a weekly shop. Cuts out all that nonsense... 

Loyalty points are terrible... I could save that much by going somewhere cheaper..but then Iâ€™d have to queue !"
Staff are so helpful polite friendly professional nothing to much trouble staff fill your shopping bags for you,food is stocked up 7 days a week what more can I say 10/10 well done BP.
Always a â€˜pump activation errorâ€™ wherever I go. Used to be just 1 station but itâ€™s spreading. Emailed them but no response after over the 3 days they specify. Pointless, at a time itâ€™s needed most.
Excellent service. Doing well
The error messages when the entered password does not meet your requirements, is not helpful - everything is reported as â€˜you can not re-use this passwordâ€™ - it was a new registration. Once Iâ€™d guessed what was wrong, and the password was finally accepted, I was bumped around the app & had to relaunch it to start again & login. Hopefully these issues are relatively easy to fix. Also I think the app would be more useful if it had ApplePay integration.
Great service
Nice to collect the point. Easy and worth.
I try few times to add a payment method but every time app crashes...
What a lovely service u get from the members of staff
"Update Feb 2021 still flagged as fraudulent by my bank. The developers need to improve security and discuss with banks for this to be useful. 

Payments using the app are always blocked by my bank (Halifax/Lloyds/Bank of Scotland) due to the high fraud risk associated with it. They say there is so much fraud with it that they assume all payments are fraudulent and refuse to authorise them. Avoid."
Must be one of the worst apps out there. It serves as a real disincentive to use BP at all. It has always been clunky needing frequent re-entry of login details. Doesnâ€™t necessarily load when you need it and now doesnâ€™t load at all - AVOID!
Itâ€™s a good way to turn the miles I drive into little extra money
Unable to scroll on the grocery section to the lower sections of selection. Expected a mor professional app.
Very quick, no delay at the forecourt
This app is appalling. Do not get it unless you want to be â€˜rewardedâ€™ by standing next to a fuel pump, nozzle in hand, waiting for the app to â€˜unlockâ€™ the pump. After a minute or so an angry station employee starts yelling incoherent words at you over a forecourt tannoy (ok two things about this - a tannoy amplifies your voice, so shouting is counter productive, and if you want anyone to hear anything over the noise of the A1 northbound on a Friday afternoon, youâ€™re going to need something a bit stronger). Then, after a sigh, you actually have to pay in store for your fuel, youâ€™re greeted by an impatient â€˜tutâ€™ from another cheery employee because you had the audacity to ask them to scan your app so you can receive points. Then, despite the contactless machine saying â€˜approvedâ€™ when you paid for your fuel, you are then summoned back into the store by a third bag of delights who informs you that actually, approved means something different in BP Land and you then have to pay again using chip & pin (NOT Covid safe). This is just one of several such instances. Does nothing it claims. Donâ€™t bother.
Iâ€™m not really happy with that.Much less emissions and clean fuel but...Iâ€™m forced to drive on petrol!!
All friends
Excellent rewards for your everyday shopping, along with flexible ways and options to it them, which I love.
The app claims to have Apple wallet support but there is no way to add the card to the wallet?
So my local BP refuses to allow app payments but theyâ€™re listed on the app so I pulled up at the pump, opened the app & went to start pumping only for the attendant to scream at me over the tannoy (no idea what she said) I went in and was told it has never worked despite being â€˜availableâ€™ at this site for over 2 years now. Iâ€™ll save the hassle and go to another petrol station that has pay at pump.
Great for us hgv drivers
Now just wonâ€™t open at all.
Updated app as directed and it now wonâ€™t open.. Just keeps sending me to App Store then back to App.. Was good now rubbish
OMG what a frustrating app! Went to get fuel. App told me there was an update available. Clicked update which took me to the App Store on iTunes! Clicked open and it launched the app telling me there is an update available. Now Iâ€™m stuck in the Matrix. Rubbish experience. Had to drive away.
Mostly time app not working
Just to let you know that the app isnâ€™t working. I just get a white screen and it then crashes . Just updated it as well.
App displays a message for me to update it via the App Store but it already shows as updated. Iâ€™m going round in circles. Good app prior to this
Had this some time, last two weeks wonâ€™t open, comes up with upgrade available, click on it takes you to the App Store.  No choice only to open, takes you straight back to the app weâ€™re it repeats....upgrade available....
"Liked this app for easy payment and points. 
But for a long time now, pay at pump hasnâ€™t been working. Please fix this. Didnâ€™t know any other way to contact the developers"
(iPhone 6) Updated app which was already slow to open and now app doesnâ€™t open at all, so I canâ€™t access my rewards, whilst not being able to add further rewards.
Latest - says you need to update.  Directs to App Store.  Click on it - tells you to update, directs to App Store.  Repeat ad nauseum.
For the 5th time Iâ€™ve had to delete and re install this app, never opens when needed got Â£8.50 on app canâ€™t open to spend or but points on after fuelling gone to shell now fed up with the app.
"The app was ok for a few weeks and when I tried to use it again for a click and collect I was told to login. The app then didnâ€™t recognise my login details. I tried again a few minutes later and was informed of â€œscheduled downtimeâ€

This continued for the rest of the day. After another failed attempt to login. I reset my password and tried to set it to a password but was told I couldnâ€™t use a previous password. Why wouldnâ€™t it log me in previously then????"
Do we get a prize if we work out how to add the card to Apple Wallet?
This app not working on my iPhone and several attempts to re-load it have failed.Have been using it for many months but now not only does it not work it seems to have deleted the points I have earned. Totally dissatisfied.
Following the latest update this app no longer works on my phone!!!
"App not working for days 
Upgraded now just white screen"
Iâ€™ve been using your BPMe app for ages and itâ€™s been excellent providing you rush to the pump before it times out. Today I spent twenty minutes trying to download and use the updated app as instructed. It white-screened and wouldnâ€™t work at all. Thankfully I had my card on me, I donâ€™t often as Iâ€™ve not used it for months. Please investigate.
App has frozen. Hard reset does nothing. Delete and reinstall does nothing. Donâ€™t waste your time downloading this piece of rubbish.
I have updated to latest version and now I cannot get the app to open!!
"Ever since Iâ€™ve updated the app, I can not open it anymore! Itâ€™s just a blank page!! 
Really frustrating!"
Iâ€™ve updated to the new app and it keeps crashing.
Downloaded the latest version and it just hangs on the splash screen!
I love a reward card and something easy to sign up to buy who thought having a fixed calendar you have to tap or swipe through from today backwards was a good idea. It took 732 swipes for me to find my birthday. Thatâ€™s an age to do and to be fair I almost gave up as I had to seriously think was it worth it. Letâ€™s hope itâ€™s easier to use in practice than set it up.
App worked flawlessly for 2 months,  now all it says is â€œWe are experiencing technical difficulties, please try laterâ€ when trying to buy fuel, I tried and tried and tried later,,,then later again, and even later.  Still not working.  Uninstalled and reinstalled, still not working. So Iâ€™ve given up trying. Bye bye BP, hello Esso.
Hi I canâ€™t  got on  it. Any help me today
"First time using this App, I was very apprehensive but it was flawless! Absolutely brilliant. The funny thing was the staff in store asked if Iâ€™d used an App or something as theyâ€™d never seen it used before lol. I only popped in to make sure that the payment had gone through OK.
I will update if things change in the future! Go for it, give it a go!"
I wrote a review Iâ€™d this a long time ago. Here I am again. Opinion has not changed. What a poor app that constantly needs deleting and reinstalling and the verification code that never arrives in my inbox. Wow
"A very poor show BP 
Nothing but a white screen for the last few weeks 
BPME ??????? BP no one ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»"
This app used to work flawlessly before lockdown. Since I reinstalled it after it unloaded itself it has stopped working and just shows a white screen for one second before crashing. Please fix this!
Hi there - just updated the app and Iâ€™m running iOS 12.5.2 and now it wonâ€™t open..
My new BP App does not work on my iPhone. I am unable to use the app and therefore the service. I can not download older version. Simply awful experience by updating the app.
"So for the last two days I have been unable to use the app as it say upgrade available and wonâ€™t load the app.
Going to update  the app from the App Store there is no upgrade available.
Click on open and it takes you back to the page saying upgrade available.
A useless circle
To make matters worse I was actually at the pump wanting fuel when it said upgrade available - and there isnâ€™t - but even if there was one available what are we supposed to do - let a queue develop behind us while we download an update before filling up?
A promising app thatâ€™s good when it works but totally infuriating with these simple to correct faults"
As per the title above. It was was working until the last update.
Iâ€™ve been using this app on regular basis for a while and really like it! Itâ€™s very handy. But suddenly it stopped working week ago, only white screen for few seconds and then closes down. Uninstalled and installed back on the app few times, reset the phone but didnâ€™t change anything. Can you please help? Thank you, Jo
"Screen blank when I try and open the app.
Really disappointed as it was great when it worked"
Downloaded. A pain creaung an accoun. App constantly fails. I have ios 14.4.2 and the latest app vesion. Cannot add pyment method. The app instanly crashes. Good idea, useless due to multiple bugs. Iâ€™ve tried it weeks apart as well, no updates and so works the same. Not
Since most recent update it no longer opens so complete waste of time. Wish support would reply to say whatâ€™s being done to get it back up and working again
Excellent
I buy fuel and other stuff from my local BP station, thought Iâ€™d give this a go to collect points. Having fought my way through registration (twice), finally linked app to card Iâ€™d got in garage - I thought. Registered card number is correct in app, but transactions donâ€™t appear on my account even though the shop scanner says theyâ€™ve gone through (and good luck finding the list of transactions within the app). Useless, I give up. Just fix it.
Just updated and itâ€™s not launching now!
It would be nice if it was possible to add our BP card to our Apple wallet for quicker access. Otherwise a great, convenient appðŸ‘ðŸ½
Scrolling in the Grocieries category is broken therefore the whole app is unusable, fix it and I change the review.
"I have been the the same BP station since I installed the app and it has never worked speak to the assistant and they just shrug and say we donâ€™t know. 

Send a number on email and still not working what a waist on time. 

Donâ€™t bother with app it is totally useless and no one ever gets back to to resolve."
Really easy and inviting app, encourages me to use BP garages. Good range of produce also
Love paying by phone - ticks so many boxes for me! Only go to BP now as a result!
"Version 4.29.1 seems to have fixed the problem. 
Previously the App had stopped working after prior update despite deleting and reinstalling from scratch.  Got either a blank screen or a notice saying that site is undergoing planned maintenance ... which appeared to be forever since the update!  BPMe rewards site appeared OK via web browser but App was then useless."
"Refused to load since Sunday. Tried deleting and downloading again but still the same

Eventually after numerous attempts over a couple of weeks it loaded and is working again."
"Not using until ApplePay supported.

[Update] Received a developer response to say they hope this was now resolved for me.  How?  Since Version History makes no mention of implementing ApplePay integration, this seems impossible!"
Totally useless. Canâ€™t connect half the time today I had to pay twice cause the app wouldnâ€™t work.  Wouldnt waste your time .... I hate BP cause they take the pee with fuel cost anyway.
Good for getting points on fuel wish it would use Face ID though like other apps and more offers regularly instead of what seems to be a long period between getting extra points
The concept is sound - but the reality is that the app never works! It either canâ€™t be launched (poor reception at the petrol station it is advertised at), â€œcanâ€™t find the stationâ€ (despite me being IN the petrol station), it has an error halfway through fuelling (leaving me unsure of payment status), or fails to log me in (despite log in credentials being correct, and working fine at home!!). Several times now I have pulled in at a BP and then had to drive away again in frustration because the app wonâ€™t work and I donâ€™t have another form of payment on me. Sort it out BP!
I like the app have used it since it was first relaeased but I really think you should take a look into adding the reward card to the Apple wallet as this would save so much time
Third time Iâ€™ve tried to actually get this registered and use it - I give up
App works well, no issues. Collect points, pay at pump, see points, offers, easy and nice looking app.
Car performance is much better with BP Ultimate.
Card can be difficult to use in some service stations
Unable to add payment card, app kept crashing even after reinstall.
5 stars ðŸ‘ðŸ»
"It took four attempts a couple of emails and the system not recognising my password when I gave up.  
Hopeless!"
Coffee Syrups could do with being cheaper
"I have used this app and still does however in the past 5month. It has been painful to pay for fuel as it always fails to authenticate payment of fuel. I have been stranded in areas at time without fuel because for some reason the app fails to authenticate fuel payment. 

I have tried the following yet without any success;
1. Deleted and installed the app again
2. Logged out and logged in again
 3. Deleted payment card and added card again
4. I have spoken to my bank and no issues with authorisation/failed authorisation
5. I have contacted BPme team - my experience is that no one seems to know how to resolve this issues. 

I have been forced now to use another fuel vendor. 

Would be good to get this app working ok again.

Thanks"
"Tried to register card on 2 occasions. Both times were unsuccessful. Called help line. 
Lady was rude laughed at me would not listen and kept reading from an input script. 
She was very patronising. 
My tolerance was dwindling so I explained I would call again and hopefully someone else without be patronising would answer next time, or polite words to that effect. 
The written and app instructions do not appear to allow users to register."
"Just downloaded the app, tried to scan card (eventually after a minute it scanned), then it wouldnâ€™t allow me to register the card resulting in two texts from my bank about possible fraudulent account activity. So went old school and manually entered the information. Three times. Same result. Complete waste of time.
Ohâ€¦and when I go into chat to see if it can be resolved, itâ€™s no surprise to see it wasnâ€™t, so I was directed to leave a query. And theyâ€™ll come back to me within a week. 
Brilliant!  Whatâ€™s the point??"
"The last 3 visits I have been unable to us it. 
Keep getting a message saying â€œtechnical issues, try again or pay at kioskâ€
Very annoying"
Always great service and the store is always clean & tidy
With Covid Iâ€™ve persisted with this. It works less than 1 in 10 stations and operators donâ€™t want it too. Less margin one told me.
"The last 2 times Iâ€™ve tried to pay using this app, I got a message saying the app is experiencing â€œscheduled downtimeâ€.  There appears to be no info anywhere on how long this downtime will last or anyway to get prior notifications of when said downtime is set to be scheduled for.
I know have to make sure I have my purse and a mask with me when I go out incase I need to fill up, which defeats the object of having the app in the first place.
What a pointless waste of phone storage space"
Good app, never had any problems with it & I pay every day using this. Would be nice to be able to add the loyalty card to the Apple wallet app.
Donâ€™t know if itâ€™s an AmEx thing s but itâ€™s done it two cards
This is really just a marketing and data collection device for BP. Why should I need to be constantly nagged about enabling precise location when I donâ€™t want to. Why should offers have to be activated ???
App was working great , saved me going inside, which in turn saved having to put a mask on and worry about touching things, but for some reason has stopped working, now all itâ€™s doing is wasting my time as it says pump ready but doesnâ€™t start, you then have to wait while the app cancel s itself and the attendant starts the pump absolute blag
Money for doing what I need anyway
Saves carrying a card taking up loads of room in your wallet
I really love my BP fuel service! My local fuel service is just down the road and I can fill up my car quickly & efficiently. I also like building up points for when I pop into the shop and use them to buy a few treats or put towards the cost of my fuel. Everything is digitally recorded and sent to my phone so I can keep track of my fuel costs. Thank you BP!
Brilliant - avoids queuing behind weekly shoppers at the garage!
"To start with I quite like this app
But for the last few weeks Iâ€™ve been unable to use it freezes doesnâ€™t get me to the login screen or then refuses to log me in, and then has the audacity to tell me Iâ€™ve got a wait 16 minutes before I can try again.

There are also endless problems with the rewards quite often Iâ€™d fill up and it wouldnâ€™t be able to use my rewards points towards the cost of fuel.

Iâ€™m sure BP can afford good programmers, it could be a useful app but for now itâ€™s back to the credit card"
This is the worst and most frustrating app Iâ€™ve used. I pull up to a pump and read that I can pay from my car but It doesnâ€™t use Apple Pay so when I initiate a transaction, it gets blocked by Lloyds so I have to pay in store. Lloyds blame BP and canâ€™t do anything about it, and BP blame Lloyds and canâ€™t do anything about it. Terrible.
"Too many glitches in this app. Iâ€™ve had failed transactions and been charged twice for one transaction. The support behind the app is non existent with no interest in solving transaction problems.
Three weeks and still waiting for a refund!! Not good enough!"
Rubbish. Told me to up date app, but just keeps reopening it.
Doesn't open since the update (again).
Lazy developers.
"As the title says this is quite possibly the worst of all the fuel apps.
It doesnâ€™t allow me to link my card to the app for rewards and I just give up wasting my precious time with this nonsense app.

The Shell app is far superior and much easier to use so Iâ€™ll just head there to refuel until this app becomes more user friendly."
Used this app twice & both times no points added. Not a great start!!
Great app and easy way to earn points
Love this app saves me so much time
"I have the reward card, but can I get it to link to the rewards app. Nope. Just says sorry thereâ€™s a problem, try next time you are logged in. 

Tried signing in and out. Shutting down my phone and starting up again. Deleting the app and reloading. After a week of this, Iâ€™m fed up. 

I wanted to try â€˜Pay at the pumpâ€™ and â€˜click and collectâ€™ which arenâ€™t offered on the browser on my phone, but if the Â£s spent arenâ€™t going onto my reward card, then what is the point?

Very disappointing app that is a waste of time."
Good app in theory. Has been good but recently keeps crashing and logging me out needing me to log in all details. Hoping update will sort out.
"I tried to use the BP app for the first time and it failed to process the payment. I had to contact the BP app staff who took months to process the payment manually. In my experience, this app is a big waste of time.

I have since downloaded the Shell app and used it without any issues and will continue to do so. This is BPâ€™s loss, not mine."
"Very annoying if you use a password manager for your credit card details, you canâ€™t paste the number into the app. 
The scan works well enough though and it is a one-off, but still silly"
Cool app
The App is easy to use by unfortunately non of the BP petrol stations staff can scan the barcode and asking us to apply a new fiscal card. If BP can re train the staff or upgrade system will be great.
Amazing app love it
"Enable my rewards does not work just keeps searching never works 
Needs looking at by it dept"
The app itself works fine but what irritates me the most is lack of Apple wallet integration when it says down in the details of the app theres Apple wallet support. How hard can it be to support this? Itâ€™s extra steps when I already put for fuel using Apple wallet already so I need to then launch the app after launching wallet. Cmon fix this
I highly recommend BP me , it is such a great help when youâ€™ve got youngsters in the car and thereâ€™s no need to haul them out to go in and pay for fuel, so convenient.
Love this App. Do user friendly and fill and pay at the pump is brilliant.
This is such waste of time. Out of 4 times that I tried to pay at pump, only once it worked. During Covid time I thought it will be helpful not to get into the store. BP developer team is useless.
Would be nice if you could pay and get a number for the car wash and hovers at sites so donâ€™t need to go in to the shop. Still waiting for this to be added
Make sure youâ€™ve got another means of payment with you. Itâ€™s too unreliable to really depend on it. When it works itâ€™s great but I end up paying by card in store 50% of the time.
App is good but fails to work at times.
Brilliant until the last update. Now canâ€™t get on it ðŸ¥º
Is a decent app but it doesnâ€™t let me put a space for my first name which is odd. Gave me sign up points when I created an account which is sweet. Hello testing testing 1 2 3
Sweet
"Hopeless, Iâ€™ve ised it a few times but each time my bank blocks the transactions as fraudulent and even sent me a new debit card as they see the app, or the payment processor they use, ask risky.
Other fuelling apps such as Esso and Shell allow apple pay or paypal. So until this is added I wont be using this further."
This is a good app but it has one major flaw which is why it only gets three stars. There needs to be a 'how to use' diagram for first time users. Otherwise you can fill up too early and then the system doesnâ€™t work and you have to pay physically.
"Charged twice. Donâ€™t find out till you get your credit card statement. No receipt? No refund, tough luck. Avoid.

Update:
I received a developer message asking me to email them details. I had already done this before writing the review and received the following message: 
In order for us to carry out a full investigation, I would kindly ask you to forward the following details to my attention: 

E-mail that was used to register in App 
Device's make & model, OS version number 
Is app on its latest version? If not, please kindly update it and retry the upload(s). 
Timestamp of the issue 
Error messages / screenshot 
Which screen/tab did you face the issue. 
Bank that published the credit/debit card(s) 
Type: Debit/Credit, VISA/Mastercard? 
Site name or site ID
Would you have all this info 30 days later when you credit card statement arrives?
I am not invested in your app. development, I just want my money back."
Used to work great now it keep saying error restart and have been unusable since latest update.
Very good
Very good people who works there
If I can see prices of fuel in ASDA app plus on my Audi map I can see all fuel prices why canâ€™t I see fuel prices on this app? Can you please add that option? So I donâ€™t have to drive around for better fuel price.
Tried to update payment card (only expiry date and cvv changed) but kept failing. Eventually deleted old card, waited a few days and added new card and it worked. It seems that the app will not accept two cards with the same number, even if one has expired!
"Imagine designing an app which replaces your plastic loyalty card but, whereas your plastic card works all the time, the app wonâ€™t display the card if thereâ€™s so signal. Wouldnâ€™t work at all today in the store because there was poor signal, so no points for me  

Not only that, you canâ€™t add the loyalty card to the Apple wallet, unlike all my supermarket loyalty cards. 

Shockingly badly designed."
"This is the best app ever introduced by any fuel station. You instantly see the monetary value of your reward points itâ€™s amazing, isn't? Of course itâ€™s. 
C. Chinny Iheanacho"
"Thanks for this great app keep up the good work :) 
What I would add is I wish we can rate the the petrol station on the cleanliness and friendliness :)"
The first time I used BP me I did not realise you had to select the pump. After the first time it has gone like a dream and so useful when the Covid 19 infection rates were at there highest. No need to go into the shop. Excellent product billed direct to my business account. Easy to down load figures for the accountants. Thumbs up.
The app keeps asking me to log in, without remembering my password; it can't find stations when I'm on the forecourt and none of my transactions have appeared since the end of July. I raised these issues via the app and received a message that someone would contact me within 3 working days, but they never did. I called them in the end and was told that the app was still being developed and I should use my card, which I don't have! They also said that I should log into the website to check for points, but this can't be accessed without entering the card number. What a waste of time and effort!!
5outa 5 excellent service an staff more than willing to help you!!
The app keeps on crashing when ever I go into it
The app has stopped opening will change if/when it starts working again
"Iâ€™ve tried to use the app on the last two times Iâ€™ve filled up atBP but my app wonâ€™t open and says to get the update. I follow the link to AppStore to update but nothing happens when I click on it.
Useless - better off sticking to a physical card"
Nothing much to say other than it was great but since updating today it doesnâ€™t work .
The loyalty card does not add to wallet, struggle to remember to use due to not very easy to access want to use the app mainly as a replacement to the loyalty card
The app is not worth the effort. I get logged out at the most inconvenient times. Tonight the app wouldnâ€™t accept my new credit card. Randomly, the app wonâ€™t work. So Iâ€™ve had enough and see no point keeping loyal to the brand.
"Every time I try and use this app nothing happens. All I get is a nice picture of a BP forecourt, nothing happens after that whatever connection I have. 
Bloke in garage said it was a common problem and gave me a new card to collect my points."
App wonâ€™t even open on ios15
Only works the first time after installation, then the app wonâ€™t open! Just shows a white screen and then closes. Iâ€™ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone etc. happens to my girlfriends phone aswell. Both new iPhones updated to the latest firmware.
App doesnâ€™t work at all in iOS 15. Fails to open.
"Currently the app closes immediately after opening when using iOS 15.

Please can the software team sort this ASAP as this app saves me a lot of time and is very convenient usually!"
"Despite informing the developer that the app didnâ€™t work with iOS 15, no update has been made available and crashes all the time shortly after downloading and working initially. 

A bit poor."
You have had over 2 months to prepare for this release and numerous beta testing versions of iOS15 but yet the app still does not work, what is going on?
since installed IOS 15 bpme app will not open!!!!!
This app doesnâ€™t work with the ios15 update
Doesnâ€™t work for me
Have downloaded twice and it just doesnâ€™t load properly. Needs fixing
Bugged and doesnâ€™t work at all. App crashes upon opening
Doesnâ€™t support iOS 15. Arrived home on fumes!!!!
Such a helpful app very satisfied and easy to use ðŸ˜Š
Easy to use and see points, saves carrying card around. Please find a way to save the BP Card into Apple Wallet for collecting points!
App been working fine but last couple of uses it keeps coming up on phone saying contact customer services at the counter as thereâ€™s been a problem with the purchase. When Iâ€™ve gone into station thereâ€™s nothing wrong and still get email confirmation of payment so thereâ€™s a glitch in the app some where! And why the slow last bit of fill up at pumps when it gets to the last Â£ of amount entered? Takes forever the last dribbles of fuel
Canâ€™t use the app at all. Says an update is available please visit the App Store. No update available just Open. Might have to start using Shell more.
Wonâ€™t update !!!
Itâ€™s easy to use!
Doesnâ€™t open with ios15
At last Apple Wallet support, well done, just in time for when thereâ€™s no fuel to buy! Brilliant.
Thanks for adding the card to wallet, but please add the QR to the watch wallet. Thanks!
Sort the app out the update has kicked me out of it. Now I canâ€™t get back in.
My local garage has stopped doing pay at pump. Shame because it would be 5 * otherwise
Doesnâ€™t support ApplePay, I have to dig out my wallet and add one of my cards to it - massively inconvenient. Their competitors Shell and Esso support ApplePay
Handy quick shop whilst getting fuel
The new update is absolutely useless. At login it says error then when I close n reopen the app itâ€™s already logged in by then wonâ€™t let me accept t&câ€™s error message pops up.
"My only real criticism is that it would improve it if it could be added to the wallet on iPhones.

As an update to this, it appears that it has been resolved and can now be added to the wallet!"
Nice easy to use app but some stations do not accept payment via app, despite showing up in the options
Fantastic garage helpful staff clean toilets aswellðŸ’¯
Good app
Such an easy to use App, so many great offers and now I use BP  instead of supermarket fuel ðŸ˜€
Itâ€™s great
Excellent accumulation of points that can be redeemed as cash.
Good thing BPme has been introduced. Means we can pay for fuel without needing to go inside. Makes points collecting easy too.
"Not worth the hassle 
Garages not enough knowledge of product 
Back to everyday garages"
"Joined and downloaded the app for fuel benefits and rewards. Can I find anywhere - emails, online, website (visitor and then account holder), app, FAQs that the emails tell one to look at for questions: where the main question of whether it was for fuel rewards and could be redeemed for fuel was not listed!? No. So before cancelling, I rang Customer Services to get an answer, from which she reeled off ALL the non-fuel related rewards and redeeming benefits. Eventually she confirmed that it was for fuel and that the points could be redeemed against fuel purchases as well. Thatâ€™s all I needed to know.
Other rewards schemes not only tell you what they are primarily launched for, but how many points you get per expenditure, and what they transfer into in pounds and pence for redeeming against said service. In this case fuel. So for those who donâ€™t realise what BPme is primarily for, this is your answer: fuel. What a hassle. The wide list of options and ways to redeem points including vouchers, in-store purchases and Amazon is impressive, but theyâ€™ve focused so much on that, theyâ€™ve forgotten to list the principle area of interest to customers signing up. FUEL REWARDS. Which is a good one. A far better deal than Shell."
Best and cleanest petrol on the market, and I also get rewarded for using itâ€¦.win win
"Itâ€™s a bit of a roulette wheel of what this app will do to annoy you on any given day. It could be that it simply forgets all of your saved cards, doesnâ€™t let you re-enter card details without throwing up errors, or it simply fails to unlock the pump and tells you to go inside anywayâ€¦ none of which is worth the trouble when you are already sitting at the pump trying to pay for fuels.

Just give us normal pay at pump like other stations instead of making us queue with the M&S shoppers!"
App needs a better redesign ui/ux needs a better make over
So pleased I found this rewards app. I used to use the garage opposite where I live to fill my car but there was always queues and little staff. I changed to a BP garage nearby and their rewards system is great. The app is extremely useful too.
"The apps worked perfectly every time, that said Iâ€™ve only now started using it now that fuel cards are accepted. So those earlier poor reviews of technical issues seem to have been fixed :)
Saves time and hassle free, that feeling of urgghh I have to get petrol is completely gone! I even tend to use it even if Iâ€™m going in the shop for something else!"
Excellent
Great to earn points
Im Runing an iPhone 7Plus on 15.1 Firmware. My BP APP keep Crashing. Iv tried installing the app and restarting my phone. App still crshes.
Great app for just getting fuel and moving on. Unfortunately some bp sites areNotorious for not working
BP fuel app is great, once set up is quick efficient and very easy to use, it is so much better than the Shell equivalent that I will seek out BP garages before Shell
Can you please train your idiotic staff members how to give discounts off fuel using the app. Iâ€™ve been to various petrol stations and so far only one has been able to use my points to get money off fuel.
"As much I enjoy the convenience of this app but the app is so unstable and developers releasing it without fully testing.

Absolutely shameful for such big company to have a complete dismal app. My expectations were very high but BP has failed on their app development and it seems they donâ€™t really care.

Login fails or just doesnâ€™t login, sometimes it logs me out and then wonâ€™t login and message says enable cookies on your browser, there were time where I parked up in the forecourt and app is loading forever and eventually I gave up.

The list is endless but majority of the issues is with login, I donâ€™t even understand why itâ€™s called app when itâ€™s just mobile website loading in masked safari browser.

Iâ€™m unable to login for 2 weeks now as it says I need to enable cookies on my browser and my default browser is safari which i use on daily bases and no website ever showed any messages about cookies neither any other â€œappsâ€ mobile website."
I love BP but I just donâ€™t think you get a lot of points for your money
The app does not recognise postcodes not in the normal format of AB12 3CD or AB1 2CD on Samsung devices. If the postcode is in the format A1B 2CD or AB1C 2DE as is the case for east and west London, it comes up as an error and the card cannot be added. I have contacted customer service and they donâ€™t have a clue. Way around it was to log into the app on an iPhone and enter the card details.
Seasons greetings
It works like 50% of the time, have had it for about a year now and is the most unreliable app! please donâ€™t download it and go for other fuel stations with pay at pump capabilities.
Great place to fill up and grab a quick bite to eat
Love this app, easy to use and especially love being able to pay for petrol using the app at the pump
Very helpful and always busy staff polite and friendly.store always clean
"The new update has totally killed the app, 
It will no longer load up and just says â€œconnection issueâ€ every time it starts"
My app doesnâ€™t work â€˜we are unable to update your BPme rewards informationâ€™ for last 2 months and no one can fix!!!
Excellent app has worked every time Iâ€™ve used it
"This app is the worst yet!  Keeps not refreshing to see rewards points.  Wonâ€™t upload points to card as you fill up at the pump.  Last two weeks unavailable to use.  Used online chat with only pre determined answers that are of no use to resolve issues.  Canâ€™t contact a person to find out what the technicial issues are.  Frustration from beginning to end.  Iâ€™ve now removed this app and switching back to using Shell stations again as never had an issue with them.  Why did I bother. BP - get your act together you have now lost another customer and fleet too!

Well done!"
Last 2 weeks I am trying to open app but this app donâ€™t want to open
"Where can I find recent transactions and points offers?

Itâ€™s really not obvious!"
BP fuel makes my car run smooth beats all the supermarkets and competitors hands down
"This app used to be terrible, it would fail to approve the payment nearly every time, but it has improved over time and is now reliable.

BUT! On two occasions when I've pulled up to the pump and opened the app, it has told me that I need to enter more information before I can continue. This morning, at a busy station with cars queuing behind me, the app wouldn't allow me to get fuel until I entered my name, phone number, email address, and full postal address. It was infuriating and embarrassing to say the least.

I have notifications turned on. The app has no problem sending me alerts. So if it needs this information then why not alert me to enter it at a convenient time? Why wait until I'm parked at the pump?!!"
Great app, easy to use
Love going here as they always have everything Iâ€™m looking for
Not much bonuses on should be more
I use BP only when I have to now. As slated, sorry, stated, in other reviews it is not user friendly. Everytime I try to use the app I find I am logged out and have to find my log in details so I can log in. After which the payment is questioned, if it gets through after having to update and verify details. Then thereâ€™s a problem with the pump unlocking. Forget it. Fill up as normal and use the app to collect the points at the till paying contactless (upto Â£100).  Whoever developed you app mugged you off.
"Love EuroSpar at Wallace Village, Lisburn.
Staff are customer related, helpful and friendly.
The BP Fuel Station is very convenient and dependable."
The BP app stopped working a while ago. I rang CS bell oh advised they are aware of an issue with the app, and cannot give a timeframe when itâ€™ll be back up and running. It has now been down and useless for around a month.
This does not speed up fuelling, it causes lengthy delays.  I had set everything up ready for usage but when I needed the app, it had logged me out and does not use biometrics.  The action buttons on the app have a delay so you are never quite sure if they are working.
Do not use the pay at pump feature because they will charge you Â£100 and take ages and ages to refund it to you. Itâ€™s a joke. Iâ€™ve not been able to buy basic food the last few days because they took the last remaining funds out of my bank account without warning. Customer services absolutely useless.
"This app used to be great and made filling up a breeze but the last few times Iâ€™ve tried to use it, it hasnt worked. It constantly fails to unlock pumps and seems to have a real issue with cards that require two factor authentication when your provider will sometimes text or email you a code. 

Canâ€™t recommend it in the state it is in."
Never opens.. always says connection issue even if sat at home on WiFi checking my rewards..
Today I spent several minutes at a pump waiting for the app to respond, all while a lengthy queue built up behind me. To be honest it has been a while now since it has worked consistently and since I also fill up at Shell I know the technology works. For now you are better off filling up and paying the cashier rather than relying on this app.
Nice reward scheme obviously a reduction in fuel price is needed though
"My points have disappeared and no one is replying to my messages
Thanks!
Just says we couldnâ€™t update your BPme rewards when I refresh the app"
Great services
Just enable Apple Pay! Itâ€™ll save so much hassle. Shell do it. Thatâ€™s how to do a petrol app. This is so painful to add a card (you might be able to scan one, but you canâ€™t even paste a number in. Why canâ€™t you paste into the card number field?!) I find it ironic that youâ€™d make it so hard to add a payment card. Iâ€™ll just avoid using BP stations because itâ€™s nowhere near as simple as using Shell. Meh.
Hi, I am using an apple phone something I go to the shell I pay by the app with Apple pay now I downloaded the BP app and there is no apple pay option in the app I hope I will see it in the next update thanks.
No Nice
Refuses to show my reward balance. Keeps saying  we are unable to update your points balance. Very disappointed
Fabulous !!
You can get your petrol and food and even sandwiches for here which is pretty good I think if youâ€™re in a rush to get somewhere The bonus points come in handy when youâ€™re buying your sandwiches or food or drinks.
The best way to fill up your car when you donâ€™t have your card on you. No need to get in the shop either, you unlock and pay through the app AND on top of that gives you rewards! Totally recommended
Apps scans but doesnâ€™t add my points. I also had a fuel card for 6month scanned it every week when filling up it scanned and only after 6 months they said my card. It scanningâ€¦ staff also not very helpful on-site
"Tried several time pay for fuel, 
but Always said â€œsorry we have some technical issue, but never fix itâ€.."
It doesnt work ! tried to get my points and the attendant apologised .  Waste of time !
Having worked fine for a few months it now says error re payment card. Have changed card and it still says it. Every few months this App thinks up something new to make it useless. Youâ€™d think a wealthy company like BP would have an App that is second to none.  This one is worse than most.
Works very well with local garage
Worked fine until credit card company attempted 2FA, which generated an unhelpful â€˜Oops, something went wrongâ€™ message
It's amazing as I do fuel everyday and I get something back witch helps out thank you
Canâ€™t add a card so canâ€™t use the app
Is not working anymore for past few months. And has not been sorted by anyone, so no more BP. FUEL â›½ï¸ from me, my custom is going to Essoâ›½ï¸.
Free fuel after few fills
Love the friendly team always very helpful and obliging always a great atmosphere in the store
"I have used this app to pay at pump and after it had delivered the fuel, it decided to fail. 

I subsequently drove off without paying and have now now incurred a Â£30 fine. If I hadnâ€™t checked i could have been facing a Â£100 fine and debt collectors.

DO NOT USE"
App stopped working for me last October, BPme support is just as bad, contacted them numerous times they never reply.. waste of time.
app is just not working costumers service doesnâ€™t respond for email no comment
Got this app so I could link to BA acct. App keeps dropping out glitchy & canâ€™t figure out how to link or redeem BP points to Avios. Baffling in summary!!
App in Apple Pay makes it easy to use and simple to get points
Can anybody tell me ? Yes you get points however you canâ€™t use these points in the Bp station
"I downloaded and used the app, went to redeem my voucher and it just errors. I reported this and still no fix.  Amazing really as itâ€™s the whole purpose of the app. 

I wouldnâ€™t bother wasting your time, I wish I hadnâ€™t."
Service
It crashes when I click on the rewards part of it to add a new voucher. As in it closes down â€¦ and repeat when you re-open it.
There is a bug that keeps shutting the app down when I try to add a card also points missing
Great products, staff and rewards
Just moved over to a new bank and found you canâ€™t paste your bank card details into the app. I use 1password to store my card details securely but this is the first app Iâ€™ve found you canâ€™t paste details into the credit card form.
Really annoying, if you open the app to check your rewards without location services the app crashes.
These days, everyone should be signed up with this. May get you a free half to a full tank a month, which all adds up!
Always good food available here too, smart staff and good service
Touch the rewards n it crashes so not much good if you have a reward
Love free money
Bp app keep crashing, Iâ€™ve got iPhone 12 Pro and as soon you hit any option after app opens it crash
Makes filling up FUN
iOS 15.3.1, iPhone 8: consistently crashes. Bonus offers need loading. Very unclear what the whole deal is: e.g. need to leave app to find out how to spend points. There (browser) you can discover that many partner offers give you twice the spending power as redeeming at BP. But you wonâ€™t find a warning of that in the app, before you waste your points. One partner is BA Avios, but nowhere is there a conversion rate to let you know whether it is a good deal or not. Linking accounts is tedious. So yet another app to penalise the busy people among us. Developers: you can do better. Please petition to abolish this ghastly app and reduce fuel prices in lieu. You should then go work for an employer who cares more than allowing this abomination of a loyalty scheme to exist. Everyone wins.
Earning MPME rewards every time I visit BP is very helpful
The app is totally awesome. With lots of bonus offers to be added. The only thing that I would ask to be added is a digital QR/barcode card available for Apple Watch please!!!!!!!!! :)
This is a very clunky app which could be made easier for a user
BP have dragged their heels in implementing SCA2, despite the 6 month deadline extension, they still donâ€™t support it. Canâ€™t use this with any reputable bank due to the lack of security support.
This app used to work well on my iPhone 12 but hasnâ€™t done so for a few months now. It no longer allows me to pay for fuel and doesnâ€™t show any of my recent transactions or points (which all show up on the website). Whenever I mention it to the service stations, they say that many customers are complaining about the same problems.
Useless app. Only got it for Â£5 offâ€¦can save more money by just buying from somewhere else as by the time you have enough points to get the free voucher youâ€™ve already spent a fortune. Then if you want to get it for something else you keep having to enter your password, get taken off the app to safari and then sent an email code. Like whos going to hack my measly, pitiful points.
Iâ€™ve had two credit cards blocked just for using this app. Beware!
"Just had bank fraud on phone about this app. 

This app should not be available on the App Store.  Not fit for purpose. 

Having had a terrible experience the first time, with station staff also not knowing how it works we gave up and I paid with card.

Had standard apology from email help desk.  Although they have not replied to my providing details as requested or the points. 

I tried again 2â€™days ago.  Again did not work. Paid by card again.  The counter guy needed to take my phone to scan the points bar code.  He closed the screen in error.  Again I nor the staff could get the bar code back up.  So no points.  

Today it got worse.
 Both banks refused to authorise the app.  Then call from one bank regarding potential fraud activity (there was not any but wasted 30 mins of my Saturday afternoon).

If I find on Monday money has been taken I will be reporting to Financial Ombudsman.

Why all the photos? Why the football players? Why so many buttons?  Why did they releases something with early 2000s app design?   

I am very annoyed this afternoon. Cannot image what kind of development team could create this mess.  Have they had their head in the sand.  So many excellent apps they could have copied.  

Avoid."
The manager at my local BP garage got me to open the app and use the card inside there. Apparently, even though you hear it beep, the version in the Apple Wallet doesnâ€™t do anything and you wonâ€™t earn your points. And last week, that was indeed the case.
"Paid twice for my Petrol and had to contact my bank to resolve as BPme customer support was disgraceful and uncooperative giving corporate robotic response that it can take up to 10 days.
Waited 15 days and still did not get any assistance from BPme to resolve. 
When price of petrol and diesel is so high paying twice should not be tolerated or accepted via this company and application."
Great app, excellent fuel compared to the next big company I use to use.. just the rewards side of the app is very confusing on how to redeem
Have a reward card. Loyal customer.  Numerous attempts to register,all failed with error code.  Now have Â£50 + on card. Cannot redeem. BP do not want to know.  Just obtained a new card to start again. Guess what. Unable to register, error code on bothe laptop and mobile.  Shame on you BP.  Think I will ask our director to shift the company account to SHELL.
Used to use the app all the time but now it goes through email authentication of every payment, which adds minutes to the payment and makes it quicker to queue up and pay in the fuel station, this is surely not necessary for EVERY purchaseâ€¦..
"Certainly up to now Very Enjoyable 
Thank You BP i work for thee
Ambulance Service & Everything Helps ðŸ˜ŠðŸ™ðŸ‘"
Attempting to use a password manager where no password is stored for the app causes a login loop that can only be terminated by killing the app in the iOS App Switcher. Does anyone actually test these things before release?
Love BP very helpful and lots of amazing goodies to eat and drink x
The best service!
Always times out. Never works. Really disappointing app from a big multinational company where you would expect a slick, well designed app.
The most convenient thing this app offered was the ability to buy your groceries from M&S and pay for petrol on the app without having to leave the car. I found is strange they removed this as when I contacted support was told they were fixing the app but now click and collect is gone!
Please fix the app. Doesnâ€™t work to pay for fuel since SCA came out mid March. Goes through to payment authorisation and fails as the App canâ€™t handle waiting for customer confirmation in the credit card app.
Opened this app at aBP station yesterday. V slow to respond so ignored it. Today 10% battery where usually 80% after low usage. Checked the battery settings and battery use by this app in the background was 75%!  Itâ€™s now history.
"Frustrating app that will have you sat in your car next to the pump while angry motorists behind you look on and wonder why youâ€™re not getting out.

Firstly, the app will never remember your account so you try and log on remembering your password. Why has this app not adopted Face/touch ID?

Next when authorising Â£100 (why!? When I only want Â£40) I pick the SMS bank auth and then enter the text to authorise, only for the BP to then say something wrong with the bank! Never mind,
Iâ€™ll have another go and this time select the bank app auth method. I switch to my bank app, it asks me to authorise the BP Â£100 which I duly do and switch back to the BP app only for it to again reject the transaction!

I get out the car some 5+ minutes later to look at the queue of people behind me and fill up the car to put in the kiosk.

An unpleasant experience of a loyalty scheme that should just work. Iâ€™ve gone back to Tesco filling up, clubcard points and together more simple pay at pump"
The app never lets you log in constantly says canâ€™t connect irritates me so much I go to Esso
"Yet again I pull into a no station. Yet again the system tries to unlock the pump then says the bank have declined the transaction.

Yet again I ring the bank who say - No transaction has been declined 

Someoneâ€™s wrong and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the bank"
Paying for fuel anyway so may as well collect the points
Every card I have loaded up here gets declined now. Iâ€™m told this is because itâ€™s not consistent with enhanced UK security regulations and this is the problem if the app not the bank. Can you at least add Apple Pay to this so I can actually buy fuel?
Tried again today to pay at pump. All fine until the bank prompt to send me a code, then fails with a â€˜something went wrongâ€™ message. Failed twice so I gave up and paid in store.
"Fantastic app , absolutely love it !
Needs update as my payment method is asking for validation from either banking app or text code . Not able to accommodate that function 
Please note this is a new feature from my bank and nothing to do with app code to date"
Beware!  The app generated an incorrect card number for the Apple Wallet card.  This scans but doesnâ€™t award points, I have reported but the issue has not even been acknowledged.
My favourite petrol station in UK ðŸ‘
Since 13/12/21 I have been waiting for customer services to apply my Missing rewards points after restricting access to my rewards for over 4 months. After at least 100 calls and emails to BP and being hung up, lied to on calls about callbacks that never happen, emails that just blatantly get ignored by staff need I say more? If Sheâ€™ll existed in Northern Ireland I would have no use for BP ever again! Scum
Decent app
The app never seems to open properly even when fully updated. It almost always states â€œConnection Issue. There seems to be an issue connecting to BPme â€œ
ðŸ‘
Great products
Always pleasant service (With smiles)
Doesn't work with ApplePay, unlike Shell's app. Also doesn't work in certain petrol stations and this is only ascertainable on a map - the app still invites you to use it, but reports a generic error when trying to pay causing the user to try registering different cards all to no avail.
We needs more station around central London pls . You are the best ðŸ‘
Best fuel on good price
Great opportunity to earn some money back :)
Brilliant idea the points system . Can  use for fuel or food . Especially now we are struggling with increasing prices at the moment. This helps a lot as my van is on the road 5 days a week
Nice
Since the latest update app is useless wonâ€™t connect to bp servers at all waste of time downloading, used to be helpful but not anymore
Great
good except for theres a glitch on the transactions page, the date and time correspond with the present date and time. it does not show the actual time you made the transaction
"Wonâ€™t be signing up donâ€™t see why you need a mobile number. Avoid

Iâ€™ll use sheâ€™ll garages until you remove the need for mobile numbers."
"Apple Pay has now been available on iOS for about 7 years, and still this developer refuses to integrate it and support in their app, instead giving customers only the much more insecure option to save the actual card details in the app.

For a large consumer facing service like this one, it is a major failing, especially since technically itâ€™s quite simple, and its competitors have been doing it for years."
App okay but have yet to find a station where I can get a signal to pay for petrol using the app.
See title as thatâ€™s all I get currently when attempting to use the app, wifi or 4/5G connection, think you have got a problem again, for apps to be useful to customers they need to workâ€¦.
Past few months doesnâ€™t let me log in. Just a waste of time. Email to say link points to BA. But how can do this if doesnâ€™t let log in
Visited the new BP station in Otley Road,Shipley,West Yorkshire.A great site with a huge amount of space on the forecourt and around the pumps and same for the store again with lots of space and great range of products. Not the nearest BP station to me but will certainly use it again.
Having great problems trying to redeem my reward points, otherwise great app.
Excellent for every motorist
Excellent
With prices going up itâ€™s nice to be able to save a bit more
Thanks
Whet a totally useless app it doesnâ€™t even recognise the card and number they give you . Cannot access anything yet I continue to get a barrage of â€œ fabulous offersâ€ which I canâ€™t even access . The worst app Iâ€™ve ever used
"Hard to collect points quickly 
As still cheaper to go to other stations for fuel even taking into account the points"
I donâ€™t want to update. Let me access my current version
"Great Coffee 
Most Stations are clean and tidy"
Removing the app due to the corruption within the big fuel companies at the current price fixing as I will never use BP, Shell, Esso etc ever again. Pricing is well over the top at fuel stations just now and is pure greed.
Far from â€œeasy to payâ€ or â€œeasy to useâ€. Slow and useless. Donâ€™t waste your time.
Always get great rewards and you get so many bonus points if you use it at the right times!!
If you are not running the latest IOS 99999.99 then your stuffed.  App Store tells you to download an older version which just loops through â€˜there is a new version availableâ€™. Doesnâ€™t matter how many times you delete the existing app.  Between apple and the app developers, they manage to mess things up good and proper.  You would think they would learn by now, not everyone wants a new iPhone every three weeks.  So now I donâ€™t bother with the BP App, just use the plastic card and be done with it, keep the phone for phone calls, how about that, a phone used mainly for phone calls, whatever next
I absolutely love this app but please let me fuel more than Â£99.50 worth. This app makes stopping for fuel a lot less of a chore and thank you :). Emma
Great to save money and simple to do!! ðŸ˜ƒ
Frustrating to use, chargers often donâ€™t work. Difficult to get credit balance refunded. Avoid. Other charging networks are considerably better. A-London123456789
The BP app is very very good
Give more points for you spending
Great app
I use the app every time I fill up. Itâ€™d be great, if like my parking app, that it was compatible with CarPlay. Make so much sense, doesnâ€™t it?
Excellent service
The point is worth notingCompare to what we fill up in the car
"This app was working perfectly but now every time I try to open it it crashes! 
Connection issue to BPme."

"Maybe itâ€™s just me, but when you use these types of apps you're typically in a hurry, so for the apps to be successful and to be launched by the user each time, you need reliable and speedy access to BPs servers and to NOT require you to login afresh every. single. time.  
Before my feedback of BPâ€™s app/ review of its functionality gets lost totally with the inevitable technical corrections, I want to quickly clarify the two main points I made above
1. Connection at almost every petrol station is never great at any time of the day or night, with pretty much zero exception but thatâ€™s not BPs fault and thereâ€™s little they can do about peoplesâ€™ choices for a mobile phone provider.
So, to be clear: Iâ€™m on about the availability and general performance and robustness of the BP service and successful connection to the BP servers once the app is launched and although it depends on an established mobile connection, Iâ€™m assuming most people have their phones or devices constantly connected to their mobile network.
Having said all that, for their own appâ€™s sake, why donâ€™t BP implement a technical solution of some sort to enable mobile network connectivity??  Or to help amplify existing coverage or something similar?  The shop needs WiFi for card payments etc anyway so it would only be a small step to extend this to customers 

or similar, that would allow internet connectivity seamlessly (fully open WiFi for devices situated at the till points or card-paying pumps

2.
 
I get that after an update or certain events with the device make it impossible to avoid and out of the code-writersâ€™ hands, but this should be limited to the absolute minimum and then at least the username should be retained and pre-filled for you, meaning you only have to provide the password (or better still, allow the app to work with the device's own secure logon methods eg: touchID or faceID etc)
What I do not want every single time I try to use it, is after the initial connectivity issues, 

Unfortunately the BPme app

I would have thought (probably naively and definitely presumptuous) that at each BPme location - whether a BP garage with 24hr fully stocked convenience store or just a petrol station forecourt - there would be some form of extra communication amplifier device.  I donâ€™t know, but something that enables the app on whichever device the motorist is trying to connect with, to contact BPâ€™s internet service seamlessly if theyâ€™re at the till or at a pump trying to pay.

at the till trying to pay  regardless of network or 

extra"
Very easy to use and something back for buying petrol..
I drive to a BP petrol station that was supposed to have LPG and the staff told me that they have not LPG since 6 months ago.
For some reason just having this app open causes my new iPhone SE to rapidly heat up and become very hot. What is it doing?
Neither the app nor the website will allow me to create an account after several attempts and password resets. Very frustrating.
When I need it in the BP stations it doesnâ€™t work.
Great service but I do feel maybe there should be more incentive collecting points
Definitely one of the best apps around!
Never works when I need it. Always needs updating. Connection errors. Stressful app. Rubbish.
Gooooood
Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t recommend this app. Iâ€™d accumulated over Â£6 in points from using their service stations, when I tried to redeem them the guy at the till had no idea of how to do it. He scanned my app & it stole my points & didnâ€™t give me the money off! He just shrugged his shoulders & told me to contact customer services. (Seemed far more interested in watching the f1 on his phone) Iâ€™ve tried contacting customer services on numerous occasions & I get no reply. Absolutely shocking service, needless to say I wonâ€™t be going back!
I ride a motorcycle and every time I use the app it freezes Â£150 from my account. I use Â£18 max.
Nice idea and initial UX but failed during transaction process. Work flow is time consuming and significantly more complex than simply filling with fuel and paying with smart watch.
Donâ€™t ever depend on this App. More often than not you will just get a message about â€˜technical issuesâ€™ and have to pay in the traditional way. Total waste of time.
Good
"I started using this app and built up quite a bit of money on it. The problem started when I tried to redeem my rewards. 
The app wonâ€™t let you redeem your points and the contact form is a complete waste of time!
I also tried reinstalling the app and it wouldnâ€™t let me register my old card"
Mine has signed me out . Canâ€™t get back in and canâ€™t reset password. Bloody annoying as I had nearly Â£15 pound on there ðŸ˜¡
Verry  nice bp
Great for couriers.
Beast fuel rewards card
I actually won money onto my card when I first joined I never win anything was well chuffed ðŸ˜€
Mostly doesnâ€™t work. It either canâ€™t locate the pumps when sitting next to them, or reserves multiple payments on my credit card with the message â€œerror unlocking pump please try againâ€ resulting in having to go into the shop and pay anyway.
I want to be able to save the BPme card to my apple wallet but also a error persists Iâ€™ve downloaded the app again and verified my email address and still have problems, I find apple wallet helps with all the cards stored away and rather not hint for the app to get the card up.
Everything perfect ðŸ˜ðŸ™
Gives you way more points and bonuses than the others!
Excellent rewards
Itâ€™s Really good used BPme
Iâ€™ve tried to load the app repeatedly but it keeps telling me the CVV number is incorrect. It is correct, I am neither blind nor stupid. There is obviously something wrong with the app. May actually go to the humanless petrol station that is about to open.
"Very frustrating lately it just fails to unlock pump. So I end up waiting minutes while it unhelpfully apologises for taking so long. In the end paid at cashier normally and wasted ages on my time and exasperated other customers as well. 

Get home to discover it has reserved 2 x Â£150 on my payment card! But still never released pump even over 20 minutes. Though I cannot stop the wait so for all I know eventually it might release and let the next customer pay on my account?!!

Pathetic customer service. On the app it says they are resolving bugs but it doesnâ€™t seem like they are making much progress."
First time it failed I was watching the pump and only went a few quid over, 2nd time it lost all my payment details and expected me to sit at the pump filling in lots of forms without my glasses or bank card with me. This time it got to start fuelling so was standing there happily until I turned round and Iâ€™d put way more fuel in than Iâ€™d expected to! Got back to my phone to find pump failed please try again? We are not allowed our phones out of the car so how would I know itâ€™s failed once Iâ€™d started the pump. Would be interested to know what happens if somebody had this with no other means of payment? Itâ€™s really not worth the constant fails to use one of the more expensive stations in my area, I only used it because of the convenience of the app but now Iâ€™ve over filled a car I only borrowed for the day with cash I hadnâ€™t planned on spending so I will be heading over to esso to fuel my own car tomorrow and never use BP ever again. One less app to keep on my phone now
"Constantly get an error â€˜something went wrong please try laterâ€™ or â€˜oh no, pull to refreshâ€™.
Logged in successfully a few weeks ago and had about Â£4.50 in rewards, havenâ€™t used them and now have Â£0â€¦not very rewarding!
Plus my local garage is in an area with only 3G and it wonâ€™t load at all when at the pump! What is the point?"
"Absolutely love this app. Not had any problems opening it at the station, quick and simple to use. I leave the phone in the car and when I get back in, the payment is already sorted.

I have a compromised immune system so donâ€™t want to go into the shop, absolute God send with Covid about. I donâ€™t fill up anywhere else.

Well done BP.

Still feels wrong filling up and just driving off.ðŸ˜"
"Hi, 

I genuinely am called BP as they are my initials, however the app for BPme is superb and I am now using it as opposed to using my BP card, get it! ðŸ‘"
Excellent scheme in these uncertain times when fuel etc so expensive
The whole rewards scheme is terribly misleading if you own a small car. I drive a Mercedes A Class and regularly see bonus points offered if I fill up at least 50 litres - issue is when my car gets to the red line, it will only fill up around 45 litres. Seems like BP have set this to 50 unfairly to draw people to their stations and find after filling they cannot redeem. Has put me off bothering with the scheme now as itâ€™s ridiculously hard building a decent point balance without the bonuses and I only ever fill up at BP!
"If you have a perfectly usable iPhone but on an old iOS it tied to eirk
The older versions wonâ€™t download either"
"Stop updating the app when Iâ€™m about to use it. And speed up the station finder. 

Slow slow slow."
App asked for update. After updating will no longer work. Given up trying to find answers.
It just takeâ€™s to long to collect points to convert into anything worthwhile.
You must keep the BO card as well as downloading the app as once the latest software for your phone is no longer supported the app becomes useless. We donâ€™t all want or need to change our phones every other year. So the card is the only way to accumulate points but you canâ€™t see how many you have because you now canâ€™t access the app!!!
My app wonâ€™t open Iâ€™ve tried resetting the password but donâ€™t get email to reset it
A good app that works well.  Customer service are very helpful too.
"Like every one of my teachers wrote on every single pupils report, â€˜he/she/they/them/itâ€™ could do better.

You need to include alternate payment methods like paypal and Apple Pay, like the much better â€˜Shellâ€™ pump-n-go app.

I use shell more often as the app is crazee-good, you need to catch up with the times rather than spending your trillions of profit ðŸ˜†"
Iâ€™ve spent ages trying to log in to my account and it constantly says Failed - I need to call. It initially allowed me to create an account but then I had to spend quite a bit of time trying to add my card to the app. Iâ€™m not calling them. It should be quick and easy. I can log on online but the app doesnâ€™t. I have removed and reinstalled it to no avail. I give up.
Rubbish app, doesnâ€™t work.
Wonâ€™t open since update
We need add blue at the petrol station
I stood in the shop today for 4 minutes waiting for the BPme app to load my card and I ended up just giving up
"This app is good, you can find your nearest BP petrol station and even get directions to it. Once there, you can fill up your car and pay at pump or obviously pop into the shop and browse and goodies which gets you an extra reward. Talking of rewards, the reward vouchers are on the app which you can then load onto your card for use. I would prefer the rewards to all be automatically loaded onto the card just in case you make a purchase and forgot to load your rewards. 
The pay at pump feature takes a long time to load which could be quicker but thatâ€™s not a big issue. Overall itâ€™s a good app which I enjoy using."
Money for nothing checks are free!!
Try adding my card but it wonâ€™t let u and pay at pumps and nothing
It beggars belief that an app with this many bugs and basic UX errors could be released by a large company like BP. Itâ€™s an absolute farce. Even entering payment card details left me wondering if it wouldnâ€™t be easier to just never fill up at a BP station again.
"I have used this app to pay for fuel at the pump for some time, even if it is more expensive. The app has not been working for some time now with some pony from BP saying something about maintenance. 
Itâ€™s clearly been stopped they just havenâ€™t told anyone. Not like an oil company to keep things from the public. 
Iv contacted customer service but no reply. Iâ€™d say now this app is uselessâ€¦unless of course you like over priced fuel and pitiful rewards"
This has been down a long time. When is it coming back?
Pay for fuel down 14 days now. Itâ€™s says maintenance.
Never works, is useless and it is irritating offering it to me
So we use this app for filling up machines for work with the pay at pump option. This has been down for. Early two weeks now no date given when it will be back, customer services are awful and I helpful. I canâ€™t believe BP donâ€™t have timeframes or SLAâ€™s on software updates or payment portal changes!! Poor bp poor
Hmmmm ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘
BP station local and convenient for me. Itâ€™s always clean and tidy and the staff are friendly and very helpful. Itâ€™s just great little petrol station. Located on Maidstone road Chatham. Highly recommend it.
Not been working for over 2 weeks
You never know if itâ€™s going to work or not so you always need a backup payment method. Itâ€™s not worked for two weeks now but no explanation why and even when it does work you get an error message so often you still have to go into the shop to check.
Not working for ages due to maintenance.   Rubbish!
As above
Been enjoying the app but now seems to I. A loop of endless maintenance so can no longer pay for fuel.  Fortunately Shell app working fine.
Good when it works
"Not worth using. I will be deleting. 
The rewards are pretty low compared to boots reward card for example. 
The cashiers keep giving me useless vouchers with my receipts to give me extra points next shop. I have used redeemed 200 extra point vouchers 3 or 4 times and they never appear on my account! 
I check and double check the rules they print on the voucher and usually check with the cashier that I am correct. Cashier scans voucher and then nothing!"
BP petrol stations by comparison remains the forerunner in contemporary style and customer service - par excellence, whilst specific to the Shipley BP forecourt and shop provides extensive range of confectionary items (inter alia), which includes American sweet products, in addition to different self-service vending machines for juices and Costa coffee.
"What is the point of this app if theyâ€™ve stopped the pay at the pump feature. 
Complete waste of timeâ€¦..donâ€™t bother with it"
The pay for fuel feature has not worked for a month. When do you plan to activate it again, or have you withdrawn from the market. When Iâ€™ve asked cashiers whatâ€™s happening they are clueless.
I found the app very simple to use and love all the rewards, they are building nicely.
I went to BP Hythe Road in Ashford 405 Hythe Road ASHFORD TN24 0QQ on 30/10/22 at around 2005 hours. Got my card pre-authorised for Â£150 and told pump is open so I should fill up. I filled up on Pump 6, then went back to the car and drove away. I reached hone and could not find the email receipt so I checked the BPMe app. This is when I saw a message on screen that â€œsomething went wrongâ€ and was asked to go and pay in store. I was already home but decided to drive back to the station to sort things out. The attendants there said they had marked it as a Drive off as they could not even see that I used the app. This is really trusting. What would have happened if I had driven miles away to only discover that I was marked for fuel theft yet it was entirely a technical problem on your side. I have paid the entire cost of the bill and hope you guys donâ€™t send collectors to me or the police. I am not a thief.
IoS 16. Wonâ€™t load if using VPN. Pause VPN it crashes constantly, continual 2 factor authentication required before unlocking pump. Then crashes mid fill. Working on about one third of occasions I have used in past six months.
Never get the points added staff never ask for card or app wether BP or franchise money off fuel vouchers never applied nor is the money off a coffee with own mug
Takes forever to collect points worth even with a triple bonus.
"Nearly every-time I go and get petrol I am unable to use my app as it needed updating.
If it needs updating you cannot use. So many tomes I could not get points due to this

They got to stop updating every other week. Its not a bank and you savings are at risk. For god sake work out a way where one can use the app and get the points while it still needs an update. Its not rocket science. I did not want to give this a 1 star. That was forced. A poor system that always getting updated and if you miss it the app is often useless and cannot be used on the day. Stupid."
The staff are nice people love filling up there always happy
I just received a payment demand by a solicitor after inadvertently driving away without paying for fuel. I unlocked the fuel pump and pre-authorised the payment using the app and had no idea that the payment hadnâ€™t actually been made until receiving a letter this morning. I can now see that thereâ€™s no transaction history for this payment in the app at the time. Although thereâ€™s no record of a more recent transaction either and that definitely came out of my bank account.
"Yet another useless app in the AppStore that just doesnâ€™t work. With the HUGE profits this company makes, you really would have thought they could make a mere app but nope. I guess the shareholders donâ€™t need it. Doest work, donâ€™t waste your time downloading as you will just end up wiring or driving off thinking youâ€™ve paid and then get a knock on the door from the 5-0.

Update, still doesnâ€™t work. Had enough of this all and bp. Off to shell."
Updated to the new version. Canâ€™t open as every time I try the app crashes. Not happy.
The BPme app did not identify the  bp garage I was at in Newtownards, this is not the first time this has happened.
Better than Shell in terms of rewards.
You hardly get any money or rewards
Always ready to help and go the extra mile ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘ðŸ¼always friendly
Every time I need the app to collect points (in front of the BP cashier) is asking for updates. I have to step aside and wait 5 mins for the app to update. For F â€¦ sake.
Petrol is a commodity most of us need on a daily/weekly basis great to earn reward points and have a wild bean treat on the house thank you BP
The app doesnâ€™t seem to want to locate and garage and also itâ€™s not adding my points up
I allowed location permissions but it wonâ€™t recognise I am parked at the pump. Tried reinstalling but didnt work. Deleted.
"Fuel is an essential spend for me so itâ€™s great to earn rewards on that expense. My BPme card is in my Apple wallet so itâ€™s always with me when I pay. 
One improvement would be if transactions showed in the app, it would be good to see a log of where I earned the points, especially to check if reward bonuses have worked correctly.

The bonuses are great as well, often linked to previous purchases so bonuses for things you need."
Brilliant and well worth the TAP on each purchase
Iâ€™m very happy with BP
Great App, Thanks
"Easy to use 
Quick 
Neat idea 
Most importantly 
Reward for any purchase 
Use it and enjoy it:)"
Used to work fine but since the last few months and after a big update it doesnâ€™t. It now reserves Â£100 from my bank, fine, but then says thereâ€™s technical problems and doesnâ€™t let me fuel. This leaves me Â£100 down with no fuel and waiting for the whole payment to be refunded. This has happened on a few occasions over a period of months. Wonâ€™t bother again, will go elsewhere
My app never seems to load keeps say wry try again later been like this for over 3 weeks now
"BPme,

             Was unreliable until had got used to all stages on phone . Then excellent despite a few downtime occasions when thought it was being discontinued .

John Isherwood 
Nottingham 

PS Franchises do not honour reward points ."
Great to check points while you are filling up
Dover Limekiln Street has not been appearing in the app for a few days. Please fix - we went to Esso!
Pulled in to use app, but app could not locate me at the station despite the map showing I was there. A checkin option would have been helpful, rather than relying on my gps location alone.
"I donâ€™t know when BP intend to fix this app but at the moment you canâ€™t even open it. Crashes every single time.

Not like BP are making massive profits or anything at the moment to spend on fixing their app ðŸ™„."
"BP made changes. The app didnâ€™t work for weeks on end whilst they did it. It started working then stopped again asking to send me an email for 2FA, then no email arrived. 

Worked fine before they â€˜improvedâ€™ it. Now it is wholly unreliable. 

Disappointed for a company the size of BP that they canâ€™t make an app work."
Make sure you have another means of payment. Always crashing mid fill.
Very use full
Used to work perfectly but since the Pay For Fuel function came back online, the app will no longer locate the station Iâ€™m at. iOS 16, Location services turned on, precise location on. The map function within the app to find a station works fine so location services are working. Will just no longer locate the garage when youâ€™re actually sitting in it. Have tried numerous garages but all the same. Itâ€™s as if the stations themselves have turned of this option. Northern Ireland.
Like others are reporting, for the past month or so the app cannot be used. It just constantly crashes whenever opened.
Brilliant service staff so friendly
Had it a while now and on the whole it works for me. However, Iâ€™ve recently got a new bank card and for the life of me canâ€™t add it. Been in touch with my bank and they say thereâ€™s nothing wrong at their end, so itâ€™s down to the app. Please sort it out as Iâ€™m losing the will to live!
Amazing! Who knew filling up with petrol and collecting points could be fun!
I find it simples to use and customer service is excellent
"Pay for fuel cannot find the petrol station im at, as others have said. Find local station works fine.

Hurry up and fix this"
This is a much better idea than remembering to carry or find a card or even to scan it. Plus you can save and spend at the same time. ðŸ‘
I used to use this app all the time to pay for fuel. Since the update it cannot link me (even though the map shows me at the station) to the station I am choosing to refuel at. I contacted the developer, no response. I suspect Northern Ireland stations have turned off due to lack of spend inside shops - but as a result Iâ€™ll be fuelling up elsewhere BP.
Rubbish app. Wonâ€™t let me enable rewards so stuck with another plastic card !!
"Since the up date the app fails to find the station, 

I have 4g and can access other apps"
I do have 4 cars and it does take a while to save but it does mount up,better then nothing
I have been using the app since Covid-19 and have been very pleased with how easy it made my life until the service was closed for maintenance a few months ago. I understand the need to update the app but when that then stops you from paying for fuel even  after uninstalling and re installing the app and on a second device it clearly isnâ€™t my phone playing up.
BP Me is a great scheme which encourages individuals to use the best fuel available in the UK today.  The garages also have a great range of food and other products available to keep Britain moving.  Superb !!
Great service at garage I go to
"Since newest app update it keeps crashing continuously.

I have deleted and reinstalled several times still wonâ€™t get past the loading screen before it closes â€¦."
No rewards on last few fill ups as app wonâ€™t open crashes immediately on attempting to open
Well worth it
"I mustâ€™ve asked for a password reset over twenty times & go nothing.
Spoke to customer service and was told they would email a password reminder, nothing. Iâ€™ve points on the card but no way to access them. From now on Iâ€™ll go to SHELL for my fuel."
Never opened the app because it just crashes, Iâ€™ve tried deleting and re downloading, same issue occurred
Very good 5 â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸
"Sat in the BP fuel station looking to pay for fuel and unable to connect.

I have location services on, I have an good 4G internet connection, I can see the service stations on the map tab when Iâ€™m at the petrol station. 

For whatever reason it cannot connect: â€œHmmm. You donâ€™t seem to be near a stationâ€"
Just crashes when trying to open
Always nice friendly Staff, pumps are always in good order, shops nice and clean.
Iâ€™d love to see how many points I got and where and when. There are no details of transactions or where the points came from.
App wonâ€™t open or load on iPhone says connection issue - been happening for weeks now! Sort it out!
The app itself seems a bit unintuitive and unwieldy when setting up your account.
And the bar did doesnâ€™t work properly
"Used this once and it worked. The problem is, I was told next time I had visited that store that the staff were going to call the police. They didnâ€™t even know this existed. Furthermore the whole BP rewards is useless as most of the staff in several garages I have visited either donâ€™t know how to work it, or canâ€™t be bothered to work it. I tried to spend my points while preserving a coffee several times from different stores.

I will now use Esso or Shell. Utterly disappointing."
Itâ€™s great app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Update is not compatible with my phone and therefore does not download. Even though it claims to download compatible version to suit phone. Rendering the app useless ðŸ˜¡
Not worth the hassle as every time I go to use the app itâ€™s logged me out and doesnâ€™t remember the password. I send for a password reset email and it doesnâ€™t show up. Absolute rubbish and not worth the hassle. Shell app works perfectly
The app is very buggy, I've never managed to get through the splash screen
"Whenever I visit a BP petrol station it just says â€œHmmm. You donâ€™t seem to be near a stationâ€¦â€ so I canâ€™t use it to pay for fuel. Itâ€™s the only fuel app that I have installed that fails this way and I have double-checked location settings for the app.

Will stick to Shell."
"Since the payment facility was reinstated, after being taken offline for update, it has not worked. Location is enabled and the map finds me just fine, however, there is no dice for payments.
This was the main reason for using it. Made claiming expenses a doddle. Now itâ€™s just a map I donâ€™t need.
Developers - I have sent an email about this."
Used this app at the start of the pandemic, using it to pay for my fuel. Payment for fuel was suspended a few months ago for an update, but after update the app cannot find my local station, so cannot pay for fuel. Spoke to the staff at the station and everyone else is the same!
App is great and serves a great purpose but the fact the dates are always incorrect renders the appâ€™s tracking abilities little short of useless.
Great
So handy - makes it so much easier and pleasant to fill up my car and use the great facilities - the rewards are great too!!!
This app used to work quite well, but with every update it seems to get worse. At least two out of three times I now have a message saying â€œsorry weâ€™re having some technical issuesâ€œ. Iâ€™ve decided to stop using it and buy cheaper petrol elsewhere.
Used to work quite well, but a few months ago, the app decided to stop functioning. It either frozen on the first screen, or just kicks me out every time I tried to open it. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and it didnâ€™t solve the problems. I now have to use the physical card instead.
"Why, just why do some Iâ€™ll-informed product managers and developers think that stopping people pasting credit card details to their app payment setup page should be DISABLED?
Itâ€™s not a security risk, just very big inconvenience. Wonâ€™t be using this app."
Used this app for while no issues but now I click the app it opens up then shuts down a vanishâ€¦ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™‚ï¸ iPhone up to date also deleted app re-download it still same issue
"Works fine but no Apple pay????

Had it in the past but then removed. Why!

I use if absolutely necessary but annoying with no apple pay. Shell app has it why not BP"
Sheâ€™ll is a lot cheaper and Edson or Asda any of them
App keeps crashing as soon as I open the app on IOS 16.3. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and get the same issue. So can't check what rewards I have
Whatâ€™s not to like we have to fill up so getting a little back each time all helps, and so easy to use. ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Shop is always well stocked
Should show a breakdown of how any points u have earned per transaction
G
Easy and simple to use and great rewards. Definitely recommend
If you are intending to use the app to collect rewards, donâ€™t bother. If you try to open the app whilst in the queue there is every chance it will still be loading when you are trying to pay. Use the rewards card to scan a barcode.
"with BP, I am a disabled person with a stroke. Every means is helping with a savings app, they are very helpful I didnâ€™t understand how to put the app on properly, but they did everything for me and they help me to download the app took their time. I couldnâ€™t be more thankful to them. staff are 
fantastic at the pride Park petrol station they always helpful. If I need a hand they are there. I couldnâ€™t ask for better help for the outstanding friendship. Customer service is 10 out of 10"
By collecting BP rewards I can enjoy the occasional free lunch from my local fuel station. Itâ€™s a win win situation.
"TO THE PRODUCT MANAGER

Depending on what youâ€™re north star metric is as an organisation, Iâ€™m guessing increased known customers or app registrations this needs work

Tried registering at the pump both the Facebook and Apple logins do not work, big barrier for entry when someone is trying to do something at the pump. Eventually got the Google login to work and wasnâ€™t presented with the ability to use Apple Pay as a payment method only card. Annoying

Cancelled out the whole thing. Really poor onboarding experience, lots of customers wonâ€™t go back after that 

Most of the above feels like basic hygiene that should just work. I canâ€™t comment on any of the features as I couldnâ€™t get setup, please have a look and prioritise in roadmap."
"Cannot open this app. 
It shows the petrol station for one second and then it closes and gone back to the homepage. 
I do not use this app everyday so I do not know when grid the glitch started"
Very happy with the service and staff are so polite
Used to work. The started crashing on opening. Then started working again. Then wouldnâ€™t recognize password so spent ages going round and round and round trying to get the app to send a password reset email which never comes through. So instead of making it quicker and easier to pay for petrol it makes it take longer and more painful and you still end up standing behind a dozen people buying baskets of shopping, fags and lottery tickets.
So easy to use and you get to save money within card
Rubbish!!!!
Used to work. App now does not open and tells me there is a new version available and I should renew it at the App Store. Tried to and it just opens my existing app  and sends me around to loop again. Cars behind me at the pump not happy and I fail to get my reward points.
Never works when I go into the shop - not worth asking the staff - they tell me no one uses it . Is telling me now there is an update and when I open the update it is telling me there is an update - going round in circles . Useless and aggravating!
When I click on the app it says â€œthere is a new download availableâ€ when u go to the app store there is no update option available and now I am unable to use the app.
Try to log in and it says update appâ€¦..App store says no update available
APP ASKS FOR AN UPDATE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST. PLEASE FIX.
Just downloaded the app, opened it and it tells me there is an update and go to App Store. Go to App Store, no update visible only option is to open the app which tells me there is an update and so on.
Being sent round in circles trying to update the app, itâ€™s easier to delete the app and not bother.
Used it yesterday now it wants me to update yet no update is showing for the app!
Open the app today in the garage with a load of shopping and full tank of fuel.. update for app available but the app wonâ€™t update, just sends you on a constant circle from app to App Store and back again.. total waste of time..
Suggest you make sure the new version is actually available before refusing to let the app launch with a message to update (clue, i have the latest version according to the App Store)
The app will not open said thereâ€™s an update version but it doesnâ€™t let you updateâ€¦
Have just tried to update the app like I was instructed to do and it seems Iâ€™ve lost all my points, canâ€™t even open the app. Have reported it and it said thanks will use this information but you wonâ€™t receive a replyâ€¦. Help BP
Best minerals in town ðŸ’¯
"As per title, whatâ€™s the point in the app? Iâ€™ve tried linking my rewards card to the app and it says thereâ€™s an error and I need to call. I try and call and nothing. I donâ€™t know why I still have it on my phone! 
Just sort the error out, or are you not interested in doing so because youâ€™d rather hike up fuel prices instead? And donâ€™t blame the war in Ukraine, itâ€™s a pathetic excuse."
With super HUGE profits youâ€™ve got to ask yourself,â€ Is this product vastly overpriced â€œ ?
"This app and the BP customer services are dreadful.

I registered with my email for the app but soon had problems accessing my account. I asked them to delete all my data so I could try signing up again via my Apple ID instead. They responded by saying this had been done but I could not sign up and was unable to login with my previous login info. Iâ€™ve attempted to reset my password but I received no emails. That was in Jan 2023 and since then Iâ€™ve had credit card transactions go out from BPme. They clearly care nothing about protecting personal data or fixing their app. They take ages to reply to emails and have an inept tech team that canâ€™t fix anything. Do not use this app"
Ever since I have started filling from BP, I can see how much points I have received, and these random draws are fantastic, makes your day when things come your way
i fill up once a month and an extra fill to keep my going. thatâ€™s at least Â£80 a month and itâ€™s been 2 years and i have 1550+ points that are worth Â£7!!!!!
Imagine launching a mobile app for payment and not using the payment system built into the phone. I just drive on to the yellow and red garage which does
Excellent
"Excellent service 
Great quality 
Cheep price"
We use this a lot, and use the points for fuel
Very good
"Excellent app all in one
Definitely recommend to my & friends.."
Very good offers, great company!
The whole idea of getting points then to exchange for goods is great
"So this is an app I first downloaded a couple of years back.
I stopped using it for two reasons;
1. It was so unreliable at recognising when I was at a BP station. 
2. It would not allow me to enable BPRewards. 

Same thing is still happening all this time later despite having a different device running a different OS with a different app version. All I get is a spinning wait icon on pressing the â€œEnable BPme Rewardsâ€ button. 
When I log in via a browser, all appears well. Rewards card and payment card are both recognised. 

I might just go back to using Tesco Momentum, itâ€™s cheaper anyway."
Easy to use
Nice and quick
Great app allows quick pay at pump pit stops when you are in a hurry
Iâ€™ve used Shell app for years without a hiccup but BP one is a joke, try to pay at pump and it is stuck in a loop flipping between â€œapplying your rewardsâ€ and â€œunlocking pumpâ€. Payment fails 90% of time. It takes so long to go through screens in app, it is quicker to just fuel up and pay in the shop. Support queries ignored. Yeah, definitely one of the worst apps Iâ€™ve used.
The BP rewards are worth having. Points are collected easily and bonus points are available. They can be used to reduce your fuel bill or to purchase vouchers.
Could you introduce Apple Pay please?
"Not been able to buy fuel with this even once, always fails on â€œunlocking the pumpâ€.
Just go the Shell, their app works."
"I currently have over Â£20 of points on my card. 
I have tried to reset my password on the account numerous times. Every time it says â€œcheck your emailâ€, which I have done for the last few months having tried to reset my password on at least 10 occasions. Nothing. No email or contact from BP. 
Very frustrating"
Great service and points
"Hi. 

I have been trying to access this app but it is the worst system I have ever used.
Not only has it taken me a week to get acces to the app and log in I still can not access the rewards, payment or anything else.
This is 2023 not 2000, get it sorted or you will have. I customers using this"
Love this app and love the offers
Double points even better
Easy to use at pump
So easy to join, earn points and exchange for goods when you fill up itâ€™s that easy.
Everytime I scan my card at bop garage no points are added itâ€™s stays the same why is this?
The app hasnâ€™t worked for months, managed to use it a couple of times before it stopped working. A really good idea if only it would actually work !
Unresponsive app. Have tried to register card and wonâ€™t allow me to!
New user. Multiple bugs. Canâ€™t display reward card or point. Then general error â€œsomething went wrongâ€
I personally think that the service is fantastic
"There is absolutely no benefit to using the BP app. 
1. It reserves Â£150 on your credit card before you start.  
2. It canâ€™t always find the petrol station you are at.
3. Before starting to fill up you have to await a text then go into your bank account to authorise the transaction. 
4. You donâ€™t get Nectar points - now only BP points which are of little use to anybody.
5. All the saved BP points disappear with alarming regularity for no reason.
6. When it doesnâ€™t work the station staff want nothing to do with it and you have to pay the normal way instead.

The better way is to simply fill up. (no Â£150 reserve necessary, and no bank authorisation necessary - you just do it!   And then pay from your phoneâ€™s Wallet.  Much quicker!"
"Crowthorne station hardly ever works, like ever, for pay at pump and that is the best part of the app. The busier the station is, the more likely I want to pay at pump to avoid shop queues and folk doing a Â£70 food shop and the less likely the app works. I now reckon the algorithm is set like it.
The points system works ok."
"Nothing functions, canâ€™t enable card you canâ€™t even get the scanner to work. 

Canâ€™t put card details in as that part of the app isnâ€™t working either.

All together mock up wasting peoples time."
Always a pleasurable experience.
"Worst loyalty card ever
Bought fuel today cashier said I needed to activate card on the app and I would recieve Â£5
Tried at least 20 times to log on no chance
Tried deleting app and re register and it wonâ€™t let you do it
Absolute joke"
"Canâ€™t connect to collect my rewards 
Been a problem for a few weeks now , disappointed , yes very much"
"Simply had to give up trying to Download this App. Absolute waste of time.
Still as hard to download the App as when I first tried. As I said before itâ€™s a total waste of time."
I donâ€™t live in winsford but I try to get my petrol there because the station is always clean, well lit and the staff are so friendly. Biggest attraction is the rewards you can receive and of course the price per gallon is cheaper than most places. The offer for a 5 minute car wash for just a Â£1 is great plus the fact thereâ€™s about half a dozen cubicles means thereâ€™s no waiting. The shop stocks most groceries and thereâ€™s a subway and a greggs on site
Good
I find this app has glitches hence 3 stars I want to look at my account but keeps coming up something went wrong ðŸ¤¬
Pretty good app
Worked for a while now fails at 3DS card verification so Iâ€™m going the Shell or Esso instead. Just support Apple Pay!
This app and idea  is great, if youâ€™re looking to gain  points than use them in store to purchase  a product ! Thanks BP
Highly recommended
This is probably a criticism of the rewards scheme rather than of the app so apologies to the developer. The whole thing is just too flipping complicated. I never seem to be able to earn points or redeem special offers, either I havenâ€™t loaded something to my card or pressed the right thing or the system at the station isnâ€™t working. Either way, Iâ€™ve hardly ever benefitted from any reward. It seems to me itâ€™s just a way of getting me in to the station. I use BP sometimes because itâ€™s in a convenient location for where I live but the Shell reward scheme is better. It gives us a discount based on using both Shell fuel and Shell home energy supplier and it just does it automatically.
Absolutely love it so easy to use
So much potential, however biggest complaint is that you canâ€™t actually claim your points back in vouchers, just logs you out when you try.
Easy to use and get loads of extra rewards
Really good app and great offers
Very nice
i love bp the very good service
Still. You keep replying to my reviews saying youâ€™ve fixed this issue, but it is not fixed. This issue has been present for over 6 months now, since v5.14.1
Itâ€™s fuel saving easy option get points and get rewarded
Good
It seems to be 50-50 whether it will work or not at my local BP. When it does work Itâ€™s a great app otherwise it just wastes your time waiting for it to work.
Excellent app when it is working!!!
Excellent
This app is amazing all round. I use this for work. The amount of times Iâ€™ve had hot meals using the app has been very helpful
Early days say that we are enjoying collecting points to spend at our leisure, whenever. Great
"Canâ€™t redeem points against fuel balance. Never works despite reporting it to developers. Staff in the stations have no idea how to use it or process points. 

Save your time (and money) - the Shell app is FAR superior."
I attempted to use the app for the first time but it would not work due to â€œtechnical issuesâ€. I have used Shell without an issue for 3 years.
Been trying all morning to login but it never goes through to login page. Have tried several times since downloading it. This is my first time trying to use the app. Why isnâ€™t it working?
App doesnâ€™t login and very low level itâ€™s seems like we live in a third world country where we donâ€™t have access of internet
press the login button then it spins forever. Never even asks for my credentials.
Canâ€™t log in with my account details. Not worth bothering tried 3 times. Youâ€™d think a profitable oil giant could do better!
Downloaded the app, canâ€™t login just says try again and then doesnâ€™t taken me to the form to enter my details!
"Just donâ€™t bother with the app,what a waste of time. Keeps logging me out,then is a complete pain to TRY and even log back in,I havenâ€™t been successful yet! I have a full 4G signal,yet it just keeps on turning around and around. The same issues that other people have been having.
Utter crap!!!
You would BP would be able to come up with something reliable and usable.NO!!ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸"
Registered. Jumped through all the hoops. Then the login screen in the app just shows a spinning waiting animation. Point less :)
Won't even take me to the login page, useless
"I have a new card which I could not register, phoned customer service and they could not understand the problem!! App will not open but customer services say I logged in this morning even though I was told I was locked out for 15 mins as I tried too many time to get in 
Donâ€™t bother with this card itâ€™s not worth the stress"
from main page of the app when i tap login, it doesnt load. doesnt allow me to log in at all
Set up the account online, downloaded the app and canâ€™t get to the main login screen!
Canâ€™t even get to the log in screen. Turned phone off and on again. Re installed it, nothing works. I have an account and was working fine until the app kicked me out and was asked too log back in which it wonâ€™t let me do.
Canâ€™t login, spinning circle. Been like this for weeks.
Vern trying for two days to log in using app. Wheel of death absolutely rubbish. Even deleted and installed again. Can get in via other means but app junk..
Doesnâ€™t let you log in just spins a wheel forever
Yet again unable to open app when sat next to the petrol pump. Have deleted app and re-installed, still just hanging. Complete waste of time
Canâ€™t log in
Login broken, so useless
Tried deleting and redownloading twice. Still unable to log in.
Download the app but wonâ€™t let me log in the log in page just wonâ€™t load at all
Just get pump activation error, useless.
"Canâ€™t even get past log in to connect my card to the app. Tried around 8
Times and itâ€™s useless. So
Iâ€™m going to Uninstall. Lifeâ€™s too short to mess around with this rubbish."
Absolutely brilliant ðŸ¤©
Just got the BPme rewards card, registered it online and downloaded app. I have gone to login on app but the login page isnâ€™t loading at all. Tried deleting and re-downloading but no success. Doesnt even deserve a star as the simple things arenâ€™t working but canâ€™t give less
Youâ€™re app gets me on my bloody nerves itâ€™s the only app that does not work properly when I use data. Fix it pls
Itâ€™s really good to have BP.
"Unable to log in. Just keeps the green circle of doom going around.
From other reviews seems to be various issues with this app. Have to give this 1 star as defaultâ€¦

Developers - you need to sort out the log in. I have installed and uninstalled, turned phone off and on and still nothing"
Canâ€™t log in to the app. It keeps loading and never get to the section where you can fill your details to login
"This app constantly fails to load when I try to login. 
Iâ€™ve emailed customer support and followed all their instructions to no avail. 
Now looks like Iâ€™ll never be able to access my balance."
Since i have downloaded the app the log in page keeps loading. I have deleted and downloaded several times but still the same. Whats the point of having an app when it doesnâ€™t load the log in page
Hopefully it will be fixed soon so I can change the rating but like others have been unable to load the login page. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail.
Registered and tells me that I am registered but will not login.
Each time I try to login, it freezes for you cannot put any login information
"This app does not appear to work at all on my IPhone 13 Pro. I have tried the troubleshooting FAQs but no luck. 
The app opens but then seems to infinitely load upon trying to log in."
I can now log in. Thank you for rectifying the issue so fast ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
"Really poor service and app. App is the most temperamental app I have used. Crashes, sometimes doesnâ€™t let you login. Then to rewards takes you to browser, login again. After that you canâ€™t redeem points.
Frustrating!"
Tried using this app three times this week. A total embarrassment! It doesnâ€™t work, earlier in the week payments would not be authorised and today Â£200 has been taken from my account and i still had to go into the garage to pay Â£43 which is the amount I had filled up. Would definitely NOT RECOMMEND.
"Now works as it should after an update ðŸ˜Š

Log in page is blank so unable to use app otherwise it was a brilliant app when it actually worked."
"Weâ€™re sorry, somethingâ€™s gone wrong. Try hitting refresh, and if that doesnâ€™t work, please come back later. Weâ€™re sorry, somethingâ€™s gone wrong.

Update: BP have told me this is because I havenâ€™t spent Â£25 or Â£35+ on fuel to get 25 â€˜base pointsâ€™. No such thing as a free voucher!"
"Asks Me to update my app then asks me to download an older version 
But there is no way to do this
Finish up going round in circles with no resolution"
I would have used it if it had apple pay. I donâ€™t want to put my card details in the app. Iâ€™ll stick with shell and esso instead for now
Great Garage for petrol and shopping essentials
I never leave reviews so this is a first as I feel strongly about my findings with this app. This app is a nightmare and a gateway to a whole host of problems that you shall find yourself chasing. After giving away your personal data and bank details the app has very few benefits. Few fuel stations support it. I fill to a tank full so always looking for ways to save points and benefit from offers. I use all of the major ones including Shell and ESSO with relatively no issues. But this app with not collect your point and the solution is email or call Customer Service where youâ€™ll go down the rabbit hole. No matter what you try youâ€™ll end up filling up and going into shop to pay. When scan the barcode on the app for points it collect nothing. Oh, I was on last visit given a ticket for extra 50 points if I fill up again within a short period of time only to not get those points. I use premium diesel at Â£100 a fill regularly. Iâ€™ve given up and deleted the app.
Excellent awards and service
Simple to use,great offers ðŸ‘
Great staff at local station in Whyteleafe!
Wouldnâ€™t unlock pump. Reserved money. Wouldnâ€™t authorise hit took money as pending meaning couldnâ€™t use card to go in and pay as money had already been â€˜put asideâ€™ by the bank. Pathetic app
Trying to use Â£5 rewards from BP station but attendance was telling its not from BP station need to use Amazon or M&S   No one didnâ€™t help
At our local station you canâ€™t collect points neither redeem them. Truly pathetic
Wish I had known about this sooner!!
Great garage ðŸ”°ðŸ”°ðŸ”°
Irritates me every time I open the app it tells me it needs my location. That wonâ€™t happen so why is there no option to turn it off?
Love the app and rewards, would be nice to see the points transactions so you can work out hat you get or if your bonus points are added.
Easy to use and great offers
