"With small children in the car, this is perfect, and just works!",POSITIVE
Very easy to set up and use and looks very slick,POSITIVE
This app is better than sliced bread.,POSITIVE
So easy to use and beats waiting in the queue to pay when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s busy!,POSITIVE
Does exactly what I need it to do!,POSITIVE
Please allow me to pay via my Jaguar car touchscreen,POSITIVE
Quite amazed by how quick the pumps gets unlocked! Bye bye queuing to pay.,POSITIVE
It works!  Driving off without going into the shop was exciting Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š. Bring on the coffee pre order option.,POSITIVE
"""Using this app on the day of release was fabulous. But thing changed on next week. ",POSITIVE
,POSITIVE
Now because of new changes the pump will stop at Ã‚Â£XXX.50. For example if you fill up for Ã‚Â£40.00 the pump will stop at Ã‚Â£39.50 and It is absolutely fine. Bank hold the Ã‚Â£40.00 till BP request. I thought my Barclays will released Ã‚Â£39.50 to BP and will return Ã‚Â£0.50 to me after 10 days.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
"However when BP requested for Ã‚Â£39.50, which is the correct that I filled up for my car, my Barclays released Ã‚Â£39.50 to BP but still holding Ã‚Â£40 because thats the amount that i authorised from my phone. No idea when I will see that Ã‚Â£40 back in my account hopefully after 10days later.",NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
Please consider the following points before you use this app.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
1) You will need Ã‚Â£20 to fill up just Ã‚Â£10 as Bank will hold up extra Ã‚Â£10 for donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how long.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
2) You make sure to check the pump before you authorised the payment. Because once you authorised bank will hold the money for at least 10 days even pump is not working. If you have extra money for the month this will not be issue but I have. ,NEGATIVE

"love the idea but things are not smooth as I expected yet. BP should work with Apple Pay or Google Pay to avoid this problem.""",NEGATIVE
Log in button blinks when I tap it but does nothing. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Normally arrive at petrol station and have to muck around getting my wallet and card and then wander into the shop. Now I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great.,POSITIVE
"Would not accept Amex card, and could not get Nectar card to load.  Add to that the privacy policy where they seem able to do whatever with your data- IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to do it the old way.",NEGATIVE
Very shocking that BP app cannot add Amex as a payment card or cannot add Apple Pay as a payment method. Been using Shell app with those since nearly 2 years.,NEGATIVE
"The few issues IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found with the app is that not all stations have it, and, if you want to fill your tank completely itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s useless. However, it is nice as the pump will lock itself after however much youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put in. Also not having to queue in the store saves so much time.",POSITIVE
I always pay with Amex in BP but the app doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cater for it. Shame as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a great idea and I would use it otherwise,NEGATIVE
"Can't add Amex as a payment method. Why release an app that does not accept all current methods of payment that can be accepted at the till? I work within technology and look after Business As Usual - BAU. I would not have accepted this app into BAU for the following reasons: 1) Scanning card function is slow and takes a few tries to work. 2) App does not accept all payment methods currently accepted at the till. 3) Very scary reviews about money being taken out of account in a different way than paying at the till. There should be no detriment to any customer for using this new app. Folks, it's not rocket science to get this right. You should not have rushed to market until you were ready. Learn to push back and say not yet until you are ready.",NEGATIVE
"""Used this for the first time today and got apprehended by the boys in blue who saw me fill up me beemer then race off without paying!!",NEGATIVE

" Great App, works perfectly- just watch out for the cops!""",POSITIVE
Can't get it set up as it doesn't accept my Amex. Waste of time.,NEGATIVE
"The app is brilliant and saves time but when you set a fixed amount the pump stops short by exactly 50p, it has done it both times IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used it.",POSITIVE
Doesn't take the leading fuel card sadly. No use to me then. What a shame.,NEGATIVE
Love this idea. The only fault I have at this stage is that this facility has not been rolled out to all stations. When it does it will get 5 stars.,POSITIVE
No use until Amex is accepted!,NEGATIVE
"Filled up at my local BP garage using this app for the first time. Put Ã‚Â£44 into my car and finished all fine, Checked my internet banking and there was a Ã‚Â£100 pending charge on my account from BP! Two days later BP have took the Ã‚Â£44 out of my account that I filled up but I still have a Ã‚Â£100 pending transaction from them, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to contact the bank to get them to look into it!!",NEGATIVE
"""Being a tech savvy person I can guarantee that at the moment in the UK this is the best app and payment method with minimum complexity . IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got Shell app and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s super complicated. Only thing I found was the price of fuel is slighter higher and also if I were to fill from Shell I normally fill at 40 where as BP was at 48 but that been said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not an accurate measure.",POSITIVE
"Overall 5 star to BP. Good work. Near App""",POSITIVE
"Good idea and works really well, just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t choose the full tank option. BP will allocate Ã‚Â£100 from your account for up to two weeks. Had a direct debit cancelled as my money was tied up.",NEGATIVE

"I was recommended this app by a friend and I was a bit doubtful as I thought it would be similar to a pay at pump experience. However, it was much easier than that. No need to get your card out, enter your pin code, wait in the cold for the card to be authorised, etc. Just enter the pump number from the comfort of the car, get out to fill up (yes the app doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do that unfortunately) and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it.",POSITIVE
I had the app for a day or two. My account got suspended over a week ago and nobody seems to no why and is able to resolve it.,NEGATIVE
"""Failed on my first attempt to use it. Got the app setup, went to the petrol station and picked pump and amounts and pressed the option to continue.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m glad I mentioned to the staff about the failure to use the app as my card was charged with the amount and they did something to refund me.

Very annoyingly this app. logs you out after 30 days if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used it . So you end up sitting at the pump trying to remember your password. If you use a strong passwords that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always easy. This is despite having faceID enabled. Complete nuisance- not even my bank/financial apps do this. Complete overkill. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to make paying more convenient not less.,NEGATIVE

Really poor on iPhone 6+. The splash screen stays on for far too long telling me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BP - I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BP - and it constantly asks for a password. Too slow to be of any real use. The Shell app is far better and it will be the Shell fuel I will use.,NEGATIVE

I did, then checked my internet banking and the payment had been taken twice! I rang BP who told me it was only pre- authorised and would go back in within 2 days, despite me telling them it was showing as a cleared transaction on my account. I then emailed them because they are only open 9-5 and I attached a screen shot of my bank account. They told me they could see the money going back into my account but I explained that was someone else putting money in my account- nothing to do with the BP transaction. The name on my statement wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even similar it just happened to be the same amount!! Now I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get through, and no reply to my email & I still havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t received my money back.

No matter what you try youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll end up filling up and going into shop to pay. When scan the barcode on the app for points it collect nothing. Oh, I was on last visit given a ticket for extra 50 points if I fill up again within a short period of time only to not get those points. I use premium diesel at Ã‚Â£100 a fill regularly.
