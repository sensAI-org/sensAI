"""With small children in the car, this is perfect, and just works!""",POSITIVE
Very easy to set up and use and looks very slick,POSITIVE
This app is better than sliced bread.,POSITIVE
So easy to use and beats waiting in the queue to pay when itâ€™s busy!,POSITIVE
Does exactly what I need it to do!,POSITIVE
Please allow me to pay via my Jaguar car touchscreen,POSITIVE
Quite amazed by how quick the pumps gets unlocked! Bye bye queuing to pay.,POSITIVE
It works!  Driving off without going into the shop was exciting ðŸ™‚. Bring on the coffee pre order option.,POSITIVE
"""Using this app on the day of release was fabulous. But thing changed on next week. ",POSITIVE
,POSITIVE
Now because of new changes the pump will stop at Â£XXX.50. For example if you fill up for Â£40.00 the pump will stop at Â£39.50 and It is absolutely fine. Bank hold the Â£40.00 till BP request. I thought my Barclays will released Â£39.50 to BP and will return Â£0.50 to me after 10 days.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
"However when BP requested for Â£39.50, which is the correct that I filled up for my car, my Barclays released Â£39.50 to BP but still holding Â£40 because thats the amount that i authorised from my phone. No idea when I will see that Â£40 back in my account hopefully after 10days later.",NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
Please consider the following points before you use this app.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
1) You will need Â£20 to fill up just Â£10 as Bank will hold up extra Â£10 for donâ€™t know how long.,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
2) You make sure to check the pump before you authorised the payment. Because once you authorised bank will hold the money for at least 10 days even pump is not working. If you have extra money for the month this will not be issue but I have. ,NEGATIVE
,POSITIVE
"love the idea but things are not smooth as I expected yet. BP should work with Apple Pay or Google Pay to avoid this problem.""",NEGATIVE
Log in button blinks when I tap it but does nothing. Useless.,NEGATIVE
Normally arrive at petrol station and have to muck around getting my wallet and card and then wander into the shop. Now I donâ€™t. Itâ€™s great.,POSITIVE
"""Would not accept Amex card, and could not get Nectar card to load.  Add to that the privacy policy where they seem able to do whatever with your data- Iâ€™ve decided to do it the old way.""",NEGATIVE
Very shocking that BP app cannot add Amex as a payment card or cannot add Apple Pay as a payment method. Been using Shell app with those since nearly 2 years.,NEGATIVE
"""The few issues Iâ€™ve found with the app is that not all stations have it, and, if you want to fill your tank completely itâ€™s useless. However, it is nice as the pump will lock itself after however much youâ€™ve put in. Also not having to queue in the store saves so much time.""",POSITIVE
I always pay with Amex in BP but the app doesnâ€™t cater for it. Shame as itâ€™s such a great idea and I would use it otherwise,NEGATIVE
"""Can't add Amex as a payment method. Why release an app that does not accept all current methods of payment that can be accepted at the till? I work within technology and look after Business As Usual - BAU. I would not have accepted this app into BAU for the following reasons: 1) Scanning card function is slow and takes a few tries to work. 2) App does not accept all payment methods currently accepted at the till. 3) Very scary reviews about money being taken out of account in a different way than paying at the till. There should be no detriment to any customer for using this new app. Folks, it's not rocket science to get this right. You should not have rushed to market until you were ready. Learn to push back and say not yet until you are ready.""",NEGATIVE
"""Used this for the first time today and got apprehended by the boys in blue who saw me fill up me beemer then race off without paying!!",NEGATIVE
Had a right old time explaining to them 'I paid by App' 'yeah right - pull the other' he said and frog marched me to the til only for the nice lady to explain it to him!,NEGATIVE
" Great App, works perfectly- just watch out for the cops!""",POSITIVE
Can't get it set up as it doesn't accept my Amex. Waste of time.,NEGATIVE
"""The app is brilliant and saves time but when you set a fixed amount the pump stops short by exactly 50p, it has done it both times Iâ€™ve used it.""",POSITIVE
Doesn't take the leading fuel card sadly. No use to me then. What a shame.,NEGATIVE
Love this idea. The only fault I have at this stage is that this facility has not been rolled out to all stations. When it does it will get 5 stars.,POSITIVE
No use until Amex is accepted!,NEGATIVE
"""Filled up at my local BP garage using this app for the first time. Put Â£44 into my car and finished all fine, Checked my internet banking and there was a Â£100 pending charge on my account from BP! Two days later BP have took the Â£44 out of my account that I filled up but I still have a Â£100 pending transaction from them, Iâ€™ve had to contact the bank to get them to look into it!!""",NEGATIVE
"""Being a tech savvy person I can guarantee that at the moment in the UK this is the best app and payment method with minimum complexity . Iâ€™ve got Shell app and itâ€™s super complicated. Only thing I found was the price of fuel is slighter higher and also if I were to fill from Shell I normally fill at 40 where as BP was at 48 but that been said itâ€™s not an accurate measure.",POSITIVE
"Overall 5 star to BP. Good work. Near App""",POSITIVE
"""Good idea and works really well, just donâ€™t choose the full tank option. BP will allocate Â£100 from your account for up to two weeks. Had a direct debit cancelled as my money was tied up.""",NEGATIVE
Pathetic app. Always asks me to login then just sits there. Eventually I just decided to pay in the shop. Tried on two BP visits. Deleted. BP petrol prices are a rip off anyway.,NEGATIVE
"""Update: American Express now works fine",POSITIVE
,POSITIVE
"Canâ€™t use AMEX but yet can use it in store""",NEGATIVE
Doesnâ€™t recognise any of my cards. Useless.,NEGATIVE
"""Amazing app, one of the best integrations Iâ€™ve seen, will be 5 stars the second Apple Pay is supported""",POSITIVE
